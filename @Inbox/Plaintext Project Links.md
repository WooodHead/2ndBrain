# Links

[The Plain Text Project][1]

This is a constantly-expanding list of links to articles and sites that explain how to effectively use plain text in your life and your work.

This page _isn’t_ meant to be a comprehensive resource. It’s a collection of articles and posts that I’ve found interesting.

If you’re looking for more links related to plain text, I keep a rather disorganized and steadily growing list [in Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:scottwnesbitt/t:plain-text).
