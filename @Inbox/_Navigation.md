 **Inner-led Sense-making**
	- 000 - [[(000) Meta MOC]] **000s - Meta, PKM, Productivity and MOCs** I mean, this is where it all starts. If you keep any _category_ it should be this one. 
	- *Pages* - 
	- *Main keywords* - #MOC #maps #TOM, #active, #unsorted #curate, #tasks, #faves #productivity #pkm #data-curator #my-system
	---	
    - 010 - [[(010) Zettlekasten MOC|üß† Mindsets]] **010s - Mind** The mind is a big interest to me and is an integral part of anyone's life. It's also this high up because without our health, what do we have?
	- *Main keywords* - #MOC #maps #TOM, #active, #unsorted #curate, #tasks, #faves #productivity #pkm #data-curator #my-system
 	---
	- 020 - [[020 Concepts MOC|Concepts]] ‚Äî #concept **020s - Body** The category for Body is next to Mind (maybe you'll want to combine both categories into Mind-Body...)
	- *Main keywords* - #MOC #maps #TOM, #active, #unsorted #curate, #tasks, #faves #productivity #pkm #data-curator #my-system
	---
	- 030 - [[030 Interests MOC|Interests]] ‚Äî #MOC **030s - People, Places** This just works here better than anywhere else. It sort of connects to Interests/Inputs.
	- *Main keywords* - #MOC #maps #TOM, #active, #unsorted #curate, #tasks, #faves #productivity #pkm #data-curator #my-system
	---
	- 040 - [[040 Writings MOC|Writings]] ‚Äî #journal | #writing | #output **040s - Interests** Another word for "Interests" would be "*Inputs*". These are things you might say I "consume" (or at least spend attention on).
	- *Main keywords* - #MOC #maps #TOM, #active, #unsorted #curate, #tasks, #faves #productivity #pkm #data-curator #my-system
	---
**Outer-led Sense-making**
	- 050 - [[050 Sources MOC|Sources]] ‚Äî #source | #commentary **050s - Quotes and Figurative Language** These are any and all Brief Inputs and Outputs. It's super important to me to have a commonplace book. This is where those awesome tidbits, idioms, analogies, and metaphors get mapped. Having Brief **Inputs/Outputs** in the 500s makes sense to me because it's in the middle of everything. My Interests/Inputs are above it and my Writings/Outputs are below it.
	- *Main keywords* - #MOC #maps #TOM, #active, #unsorted #curate, #tasks, #faves #productivity #pkm #data-curator #my-system
	---
	- 060 - [[060 People MOC|People]] ‚Äî #people | #waiting | #meeting **060s - Writings** These are my longer-form"*Outputs*", anything from online posts to essays to speeches.
	- *Main keywords* - #MOC #maps #TOM, #active, #unsorted #curate, #tasks, #faves #productivity #pkm #data-curator #my-system
	---
**Personal Management**
	- 070 - [[070 Health MOC|Health]] ‚Äî #health | #workout **070s - Journal** Journal is next to Writings. These are private.
	- *Main keywords* - #MOC #maps #TOM, #active, #unsorted #curate, #tasks, #faves #productivity #pkm #data-curator #my-system
	---
	- 080 - [[080 Goals MOC|Goals]] ‚Äî #goal | #gameplan | #win **080s - Goals and Finances** Goals and Finances are next to Journal because they are private too. Both Goals and Finances use the "command center" pre-frontal cortex aspect of our brain so they go together in their executive functioning.
	- 085 - [[085 Compass MOC|Compass]]
	- *Main keywords* - #MOC #maps #TOM, #active, #unsorted #curate, #tasks, #faves #productivity #pkm #data-curator #my-system 
	---
**Knowledge Management**
    - 090 - [[090 PKM MOC|PKM]] ‚Äî [[Template for All]] | #reference **090s - Knowledge Management and Lists** Knowledge MGMT is next to the other MGMTs for Goals and Finances. It makes sense to me that this is last because it's the most meta. It's the category about organizing the organizing. It's the structure-building and information management headspace. 
    - 095 - [[095 Lists MOC|Lists]] ‚Äî #fave
    - *Main keywords* - #journal #blogs #reviews #memories #dreams #stories
	---
**Projects**
	- 100 - [[100 Projects MOC|Projects]] ‚Äî #project **100s - Ideas and Projects** These sort of transcend my 10 main categories, but it's essential they are close by. Ideas are fledging. Projects are ideas that I've actually decided to work on.
	- *Main keywords* - #ideas #project #projects, #TOC
