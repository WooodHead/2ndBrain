## Mind + Body + Spirit

## Projects + Goals + Journal
**300s - Ideas and Projects**
Goals and Finances are next to Journal because they are private too. Both Goals and Finances use the "command center" pre-frontal cortex aspect of our brain so they go together in their executive functioning.
These sort of transcend my 10 main categories, but it's essential they are close by. Ideas are fledging. Projects are ideas that I've actually decided to work on. 

1. Projects
2. Areas
3. Resouces
4. Archive
