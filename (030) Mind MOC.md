# Mind MOC
Welcome to the **Mind MOC**. First, let's define some overlapping meta-categories:

-   `Concepts` A concept is a pattern, truth, or mechanism recognized and given a name.
-   `Mental Models` are specific readily-available patterns or mechanisms thatâ€”*when applied to a current situation or thing*â€”allow for efficient, optimal action. Great for strategic agency and in-the-moment adaptability.
-   `Metaphors` are primarily for relating unlike things. Great for creative expression and a means unto itself.
-   `Contextual Lenses` are primarily for broadening perspective and deepening understanding. Great for reviewing, planning, empathizing, and meditating. 

- [x] Take a screenshot of this page #meta 


### For Pattern Recognition
-   [[Concepts MOC]]
-   [[Charlie Munger's Mental Models]]

#### For Clarity, Problem-Solving, and Perspective
-   [[Levels of Magnification]] â€” Analyzing via three lenses.
-   Thought Unpacking â€” ==Thinking critically and analytically.==
-   [[Contextual Lenses]] â€” Broadening perspective

## For Meditation and Imagination
-   Meditation Jaunts â€” A joyful sequence of various meditations to bounce between during a single 20-minute session. 
-   Mind Training â€” Imagination Practices #MindTraining
-   Mind Palaces â€” Mneumonic device

### For Creativity, Expression, and Enrichment
-   Thought Enriching â€” Thinking creatively and expressively.
-   Metaphor Making â€” List of worlds ripe for metaphors

## Unsorted
- [[Habits MOC - Unifying Phase]]

## Other Unsorted Notes and Ideas
- *Mindfulness* is really just being present, ie observing and noticing things. People lump too much into it.
- Mind reference file â€” *Being Present, Active, and Engaged*
  - This is new. I'm adding this due to the modern-day importance of having Attentional Discipline, which is so so difficult with the infusion of attention robbers like phones and social media. I especially need to put focus here when I'm with other people.

# Concepts MOC
*A concept is a pattern, truth, or mechanism recognized and given a name.*
Just like the primordial goop that collided together billions of years ago to spark life on earth, so do these conceptual collisions spark exciting and diverse ideas.

## Concepts MOC - Daily Reminders
Why not string out these ideas into paragraphs? What a way to unearth hidden connections!

Starting some days, I'll consider how to apply three *strategic* mental models: [[OODA Loop]], [[Levels of Magnification]], and [[Refraction Thinking]].

For my work as an editor/AE in TV, I know to improve my craft means the steady application of getting [[Reps]], creating the conditions for [[Flow]], which involves environmental  [[Forcing Function|Forcing Functions]], and considering when I can multitask [[Shadow Clone]]. 


[[Natural Selection]] is one of the mega-concepts. It helps me decipher the signal from the noise through the mechanism of considering the [[Lindy Effect]], along with [[Hormesis]] and [[Antifragility]]â€”and also more broadly [[Cause and Effect]].

In times of stress it helps me to broaden my perspective and consider concepts like: [[Ying and Yang]], [[Synthesis]], [[Seasons]].

Dealing with folks in the entertainment industryâ€”and just throughout life reallyâ€”there are plenty of instances to consider ways to handle ego and aggression. The most fascinating is [[No-Face]] from Spirited Away, which leads to [[The Id]]. [[80.03 Aikido]] is good to remember.

For more avenues to re-expanding my narrowed perspectve, try to revisit the [[Rubik's Cube]], or pull from [[Munger's Mental Models]].
