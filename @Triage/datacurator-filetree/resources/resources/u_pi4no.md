Firstly, make sure to separate personal and non-personal data. For the non-personal (library) data, I have 4 main sections:

1. Books
2. Audio
3. Media
4. Other



Inside each main section, I define and number 8 or 9 subsections. For example, for Books, I might have Fiction, Non-fiction, Magazines, Comics, etc. Each subsection then has its own appropriate organisation system. For Fiction, I would organise by the author's last name, so:

`F / FI / Fitzgerald, F. Scott / F. Scott Fitzgerald - The Great Gatsby (HarperCollins Canada, 2011).epub` 



For Non-fiction, I use the Dewey Decimal System (what a lot of libraries use), etc. You get the picture.



The advantage of organising everything meticulously using a folder system and not relying on tags, search, or software (such as Calibre) is that your data is:

1. **Extremely accessible**: almost anyone should be able to find what they're looking for without knowing their way around.

2. **Future-proof**: your library does not depend on the future development of software, so it's reasonably well guarded against programs going obsolete (as they do)

3. **FTP-friendly**: Most clients don't have the ability to recursively search for a file. This is also unwieldy in very large servers. It is far easier to implement a system that relies on only one thing to work -- folders.
