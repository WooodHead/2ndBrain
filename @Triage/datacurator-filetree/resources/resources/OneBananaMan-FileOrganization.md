I've been working on trying to be more organized in terms of data/file management for my personal computer. For context my workstations use is comprised of work, running several companies (on the side), hobbies, gaming, and school. I have several custom scripts to aid in keeping files organized and image and document processing/recognition for sorting in certain areas.

I am looking for feedback in regards to the overall file architecture layout. If it completely sucks and you believe it'll fail please provide constructive feedback!

*Note: this is a general layout, some folders I have structured into multiple subcategories, the hierarchy view below is to provide a general overview.*

**Total Data Size:**

|**System**|**File Size**|
|:-|:-|
|Applications|N/A *(not backed-up just locally installed)*|
|Asset Library|4.6 TB|
|Corporate|13.54 TB|
|Documents|3.06 TB|
|Downloads|N/A *(not backed-up)*|
|Engineering Library|0.24 TB|
|Games|N/A *(not backed-up)*|
|Literature|0.09 TB|
|Projects|6.1 TB|
|Proprietary|2.7 TB|
|Software Development|0.8 TB|
|Videos|0.5 TB|
|Pictures|0.9 TB|
|**Total**|31.53 TB|

*Note: Not all computers will store all this information, for example the Surface Book 2 will only store certain projects, documents, and such related files that are relevant during that time.*

**Systems:**

|**Systems**|**Description**|
|:-|:-|
|Home Desktop Workstation|Primary workstation|
|Surface Book 2|Portable system for light work and quick editing|
|Local NAS|Local backup storage system|
|Google Cloud|Google Cloud storage, the primary syncing method, also does system backups and version controls for 6mo-1yr.|
