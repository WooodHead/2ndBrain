	So, what are we looking at here? What kind of things do we have to look forward to? Well… Let’s just give a nice overhead view of this real quick.
	Make sure to have an up-to-date backup:

	- # install the scripting addition
		- sudo yabai --install-sa

		- copy over .zshrc @done(2020-11-27)
		- Copy over ohmyzsh folder @done(2020-11-27)
		- Next, install the Powerlevel9k theme, this is a fully customizable theme for Oh-My-Zsh, and it’s awesome: @done(2020-11-27)
			- git clone https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/powerlevel9k @done(2020-11-27)

		- nvm ls @done(2020-11-27)
	Python:
		Application-specific Python version:
			The local command will set local application-specific Python version(s) by writing the version name to a .python-version file in the current directory. This version overrides the global version. For example, to install anaconda3-4.1.1 in path/to/directory
			- $ pyenv install anaconda3-4.1.1
			- $ cd path/to/directory
			- $ pyenv local anaconda3-4.1.1
			- $ pyenv rehash
			- $ pyenv versions
				system
				2.7.12
				3.5.2
			* anaconda3-4.1.1 (set by /Users/your_account/path/to/directory/.python-version)
		Install.sh:
			sh Install.sh
			- Start yabai - brew update - restart all
			- Important packages @done(2020-11-27)
			- Command line tools @done(2020-11-27)

			- Fonts @done(2020-11-27)
		Set all main system preferences:
		- Transfer all information needed from old machine
		- Install all apps needed in a fresh state
		Set up Visual Studio Code:
		Setup Gaming profile:
			- Create New User
			- Install minimal amout of apps neccesary
			- Parallels VM
				- Switch storage folder
				- Adjust settings
			- Install FFXIV
				- Tweak settings
				- Install update patch
		- pip --version @done(2020-11-27)
		pyenv is a Python version manager that can manage and install different versions of Python. Works very much like rbenv for Ruby. First, we must install pyenv using Homebrew @done(2020-11-27)
		- brew install pyenv @done(2020-11-27)
			To upgrade pyenv in the future, use upgrade instead of install. After installing, add pyenv init to your shell to enable shims and autocompletion (use .zshrc if you're using zsh). = echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile @done(2020-11-27)
		- Restart your shell to make sure the path changes take effect. @done(2020-11-27)
			- exec $SHELL @done(2020-11-27)
		You can now begin using pyenv. To list the all available versions of Python, including Anaconda, Jython, PyPy and Stackless, use =  @done(2020-11-27)
		- pyenv install --list @done(2020-11-27)
		- Then install the desired versions @done(2020-11-27)
			pyenv install 2.7.12 @done(2020-11-27)
		- Use the global command to set global version(s) of Python to be used in all shells. For example, if you prefer 2.7.12 over 3.5.2 @done(2020-11-27)
			pyenv global 2.7.12 3.5.2 @done(2020-11-27)
			pyenv rehash @done(2020-11-27)
		- brew install pip3 @done(2020-11-27)
		- Remove SEP @done(2020-11-27)
		- Start building cool shit @done(2020-11-27)
	Ruby:
		- rbenv local
			Sets a local application-specific Ruby version by writing the version name to a .ruby-version file in the current directory. This version overrides the global version, and can be overridden itself by setting the RBENV_VERSION environment variable or with the rbenv shell command.
			$ rbenv local 1.9.3-p327
		- brew install rbenv @done(2020-11-27)
		- rbenv init @done(2020-11-27)
		- Follow the printed instructions to set up rbenv shell integration. @done(2020-11-27)
		- Close your Terminal window and open a new one so your changes take effect. @done(2020-11-27)
		- curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/master/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash @done(2020-11-27)
		- # list latest stable versions: @done(2020-11-27)
			- $ rbenv install -l @done(2020-11-27)
		- gem install bundler @done(2020-11-27)
		- Check the location where gems are being installed with gem env: @done(2020-11-27)
			- $ gem env home @done(2020-11-27)
		- rbenv global @done(2020-11-27)
			Sets the global version of Ruby to be used in all shells by writing the version name to the ~/.rbenv/version file. This version can be overridden by an application-specific .ruby-version file, or by setting the RBENV_VERSION environment variable. @done(2020-11-27)
			$ rbenv global 1.8.7-p352 @done(2020-11-27)

		[The current state of my GTD tool setup — Robert Talbert, Ph.D.](https://rtalbert.org/the-current-state-of-my-gtd-tool-setup/)
		The tactical side of GTD is what I use when I am in the trenches, doing stuff and making decisions in the moment. This is the majority of the time I am working, and for those situations I need a tool setup that is fast, flexible, simple, with as little friction as possible, and makes me think as little as possible. This is where the "mind like water" mantra kicks in.
