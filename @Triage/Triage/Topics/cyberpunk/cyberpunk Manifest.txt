Cyberpunks are at the forefront of technological change for the betterment of self and humanity. Their eventual goal is to fundamentally transform the human condition by manipulating technologies to enhance human intellect, physical, or psychological capacities.Cyberpunk thinkers search for potential benefits of emerging technologies that could overcome human limitations. No social, political, or cultural limitations will restrict the progress of Cyberpunk ideals and goals. We affirm that the principle of self-ownership is fundamental in the context of individual freedom to achieve complete physical, mental, and social well-being.If there is knowledge, we will take it. If there a lack of freedom we will demand it. if there is an Internet, we will own it.
