# My Typinator Sets

I wrote about how I use [Typinator](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/typinator) and [Keyboard Maestro](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/keyboard-maestro) together to automate writing in an article you can read [here](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/write-once-never-write-again-c2fa1f6c4e8).

Here you can find the different Sets that I use in Typinator to speed up my writing.

You can also find & download all the Typinator sets I use from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7cfwu8q2nstqw65/AACPu7r1GIWn4_WE7pFwJ_n4a?dl=0) and here is their explanation.

1. Smart - Snippets with more complex embeddings like AppleScript output.
2. Words - Single word expansions.
3. Phrases - Some phrases I find myself saying often.
4. Questions - Common questions I found myself asking.
5. Dates - Expanding current date in different formats like DD/MM/YYYY.
6. Fantastical - Expansions for [easing entering of natural input](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/fantastical-natural-input-text-expansions-3ea8cf7ccac3#.pv5937ncr) in [Fantastical app](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/fantastical).

I use the same trick as in [KM](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros) to indicate what information I should have in my clipboard before activating it by enclosing it inside `{}` like so:
