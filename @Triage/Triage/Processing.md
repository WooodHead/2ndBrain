# TickTick GTD Setup 2020 — Processing | by Sourabh | Sep, 2020

![Sourabh][1]

Hello and welcome back to TickTick and GTD setup guide. This is part 2 of 3 part series where we setup GTD setup using TickTick

This is a three part series which includes

1. [Collection][2]
2. [Processing][3]
3. Engage

In this part we are going to discuss about Processing phase of our tasks. So in earlier part we used various ways to collect Tasks into our TickTick system. Now we are going to process them as per GTD methodology.

## Contexts

David Allan suggests to work through context instead to working through project. Which means that whenever you are working on your tasks you should focus on tasks which can be done in the present context. So to do that we are going to create a list of Context as a List in TickTick, this is counter intuitive to many of us to have List of Context in TickTick instead of Project as List.

Following are List of common Contexts that I've setup in the TickTick

Feel free to add your contexts however, keep in mind what David Allan says about contexts.

> Most [actions] require a specific location (at home, at your office) or having some productivity tool at hand, such as a phone or a computer. These are the first factors that limit your choices about what you _can_ do in the moment – David Allen, Getting Things Done®, p.49

## Projects

Project is simply task that takes two or more actions to complete it. So add a project I use tags in the TickTick. Since Tags can be easily nested in TickTick it is very easy to add new sub project into current project. Following are some of my projects

## Areas of Responsibility

In today's world of work from home and digital age, a line between work and personal things has became blurred to great extent. To avoid this it is better to be mindful about where you are spending most of your tasks are. To achieve this I always tag every action/task to one of the area of responsibility I've to be on top of my messy life.

Similar to Projects I create Group of tags in TickTick to achieve this. Some of my Areas of Responsibility that I added into TickTick as follows

## Next Action

Next Action are actions that you could do as soon as possible in given Context. They should be physical actions and should be defined as clear as possible.

For me any Task that is part of Context List and don't have Date attached to it is Next Action.

For example Consider following tasks, 'Get Estimate for Car' is my next action whereas 'Deliver Car to Garage' has date attached and will be considered as task added to Calendar

## Someday Maybe and Waiting For

Similar to Context List these two will have their own list, reason for them adding as list instead of Tags is to avoid cluttering of the Task Pane with unnecessary Tasks that you could not work upon.

It is good practice to have a reminder attached to tasks added to these List to avoid them getting ignored in long run.

So after adding these two Lists into our Lists we our Lists Section looks something like below

## Calendar

> Note: To be honest upfront — this is the only section where I feel TickTick needs to improve a lot

Even though you could add Google Calendar to TickTick at the time of writing this, I do not feel comfortable recommending adding Google Calendar to to TickTick. Instead use Calendar View to get bird eye view of the tasks in upcoming months. And use Google Calendar or Outlook to manage your Calendars.

In this article we looked at how you could process your collected tasks to a GTD method and improve your productivity.

Let me know what are thoughts are in the comments. Also check out part 1 of this series
