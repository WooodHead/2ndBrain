\par }{\f1 
\par One trick I have learned as a technician, when the problem is data-read errors off the platters themselves, is to }{\b\f1 freeze}{\f1  the hard drive overnight. It makes the data more 'readable,' but for a one-s
hot deal. If this data is critical, and you have a replacement hard drive (which, if it's a drive failure, you probably do), then you can hook up your frozen hard drive and immediately fetch the data off before it warms up.
\par 
\par }{\b\f1 From: Thedeedj
\par }{\f1 
\par If the problem is heat related, I put the drive in the }{\b\f1 freezer}{\f1  for about 15 minutes to cool it down... sometimes this gets the drive up long enough to copy any critical files...
\par 
\par }{\b\f1 From: Itguy1
\par }{\f1 
\par Put the drive in a waterproof sealed bag, put it in the fridge for an hour or so, then have another go.
\par 
\par }{\b\f1 From: Kelly Reid
\par }{\f1 
\par Well, I won't start playing with your specific situation, too many steps or possible solutions where everything starts "If that last thing didn't work try..."
\par 
\par But I'll give you one for free that was a nice hero moment for me. Had a drive where it sounded like the drive motor was engaging but not getting anywhere, so we stuck it in the office }{\b\f1 freezer}{\f1 
 for an hour! I'll be darned if it didn't work. The drive was up long enough to get the data ghosted to another drive and we turfed it, even though it sounded fine at that point. I can't really take credit for it though\emdash 
I had heard it in some geek bull session but I thought it was some jedi-geek urban myth. Goes to show you that you know you're really screwed when you 
say something to the effect of "Okay, hold on tight, I'm gonna try something I saw in a cartoon once but I'm pretty sure I can do it"
\par 
\par }{\b\f1 From: mpicpu
\par }{\f1 
\par If this drive isn't spinning up, putting it in the }{\b\f1 freezer}{\f1  for about an hour will usually get the drive spi
nning again so you can copy needed files before the drive warms up again. The first thing you want to do is run a disk utility like Norton disk doctor or wddiag (if it's a western digital drive) to verify whether the drive is working mechanically or not. 
I
f it is a master boot record problem, sometimes running Fdisk/mbr will correct the problem. It could also be a virus, and a program like F-prot will look at the drive as a physical unit. As an A+ PC technician I have seen this problem many times. Usually 
if the drive is not making a clicking sound I am successful in recovering the data.
\par 
\par }{\b\f1 From: Scott Greving
\par }{\f1 
\par I've run into this scenario numerous times. One time it involved the main Novell SYS volume on our HP File Server. I was really sweating as the server would not boot. I took the drive out and put it in a }{\b\f1 freezer}{\f1 
 for 30 minutes. I then reinstalled it into the file server and Presto! I was up and running. Needless to say I quickly mirrored the drive onto another and got rid of the bad drive.
\par 
\par In stand alon
e client systems, the method I've had the most luck with reviving drives from death has been removing the drive, firmly tapping the top of its case several times, and then re-installing it making sure all cables are secure. I've had a better than 60 perce
nt success rate with this method.
\par 
\par }{\b\f1 From: jphillips
\par }{\f1 
\par If the drive is spinning and you are experiencing these kinds of errors, my experience has been that you are out of luck.
\par 
\par If the drive is not spinning, I have been able to remove it from the computer and 'spin' the drive on a flat smooth surface (much like spin the bottle). This will usually free the drive and when placed back in the machine, it will boot. You should immedia
tely back up you data after a successful boot, because the problem will return.
\par 
\par The next 'fix' was actually given to me by a Compaq technician several years ago. I had a drive that would not spin and he told me to put the drive in a plastic bag in the }{\b\f1 freezer}{\f1 
 overnight and then install back in the computer. Believe it or not, the drive booted. I have only tried this the one time.

 for a couple of hours, then hooked it up again. It sometimes will run long enough to remove the data to another safe storage medium.

\par One of the methods I have used before (sometimes even successfully) is to actually remove the drive from the PC, place it in the }{\b\f1 freezer}{\f1 
 for a day, then quickly put it back in the machine and try to access it. Why does this work? Who knows, but I heard about this tactic years ago, and it has saved my behind on a couple
 of occasions. (Of course, if it comes back up, back up the data immediately.... Guess that should go without saying.)

\par Hard drive revival:
\par 
\par A technique I have learned is if you bring the temperature of the hard drive down to the freezing point by putting it in a }{\b\f1 freezer}{\f1 
 first and then taking it back out, somehow the condensation from bringing it back to room temperature helps revive it for about 20 minutes. It can be repeated about 5-6 times tops. Long enough to get out any important files t
hat need to be backed up. It has been proven to work a number of times.

\par 
\par 1. Hold the drive upside down, making gravity change the head geometry ever so slightly. Vertical is also another option.
\par 
\par 2. Slightly rap the drive with your knuckle, (but nowhere near hard enough to damage the drive).
\par 
\par 3. Try the drive in another machine, (slight drive voltage change assumed to be the miracle worker here).
\par

\par 
\par 5. }{\b\f1 Freeze}{\f1 
 the hard drive in the freezer for two hours, and place in a plastic zip lock bag to prevent condensation from forming on the drive when you plug it back into the system, (head geometry, electrical resistance lowered, electrical contact points adjusted, e

\par 
\par 6. After the drive warms up to room temperature or better, rap it even harder with your knuckle this time.
\par 
\par 7. Repeat all of above steps on next day, as sometimes I've gotten data off drive simply by trying again.

\par }{\f1 
\par Hmmm sounds like a toughy to me. Back in the old days when I first started teching, if we ran into a problem like this, there were only a few ways to deal with it. I will go over these options now:
\par 
\par QUESTION: What do you think you can do about this, Mr. Tech?
\par 
\par First Answe\emdash r\emdash Nothing, your computer is too old, and the data on there is not really of that much importance. If you really want it back, you can get a hold of a company called "Total Recall" out of Denver and get charged thousand
s of dollars to get your files back. Besides, with Y2K, this machine ain\rquote t gonna run anyway, and prices are so low right now, there is no reason why you should not upgrade now.
\par 
\par 2) Well, I can take it back to the shop and pretend like I know what I am doin
g for 3-6 hours. Then I will call you the for the next week and a half giving you excuses as to why I am not able to get your information off of that hard drive. Of course, I won\rquote 
t charge you anything, but I will expect compensation for all the time I wasted on your hard drive.
\par 
\par 3) I could take the hard drive out of your machine,  plug into my Secondary IDE controller, and boot up. Hopefully, I can see your hard drive and have the ability to copy all of your files to a temp folder on my machine called "Your
 Name." After I collect all information, I would run IBM's WIPE on the drive and then a thorough scandisk, just to see if the cause was sunspot related or not. If......this was not working, then extreme temperatures always have a way of talking older hard
 drives into giving us what we want. I would then wrap the HD in a Ziplock bag and slam it in the }{\b\f1 freezer}{\f1 
 for 12 hours. Pull it out the next day and very quickly plug it into my machine, copying what I can as quickly as possible until the drive dies again, repeating until all files are copied and safe. If.....that don\rquote 
t work, move onto the extreme heat. A Shrink wrap gun works best, but a hairdryer will do the trick if that is all you have. Wrap one end of the HD in a towel and use the shrink wrap gun or dry
er to heat the hard drive. Very quickly plug it in and copy files until finished. Repeat until all necessary files are copied and you are done.
\par 
\par You may not think it works, but when you are down to that as your last option...it does.

\par 
\par Put the drive in the fridge for a few hours. This can shrink up something inside that might let it run long enough to get critical data. If not, try the }{\b\f1 freezer}{\f1  for a few more.

\par 2. Place the drive in a }{\b\f1 freezer}{\f1  for about 10 minutes.
\par 3. Open the drive case in a laminar flow-hood, and give it a spin.  (Once it was closed up and reinstalled, it worked long enough to suck the data off of it.)
\par 4. Swap the logic board with one on another drive of the same type.
\par 
\par Numbers 1, 2, and 3 worked with older Seagate (which we no longer purchase) drives, which were prone to "stiction" problems. Number 4 worked following an electrical surge (lightning strike), since the data on the platters were still there and OK.

\par 2. Check the environment: The last question from step 1 is often forgotten and can lead to extensive troubleshooting of a simpl
e problem. Look for an environmental problem that may cause problems for the hard drive. Are there magnets on the computer case close to the hard drive? Is there a fan or heater near the computer? Is a transformer, electrical junction box, or high energy 
d
evice near the computer (on a floor above or in a nearby wall)? All of these will produce a magnetic (or electromagnetic) field that can cause problems. Equipment that may vibrate the computer even at a very low frequency can cause hard drive heads to ski
p and jump or even scratch the platters.
\par 
\par 3. Turn off the computer, remove the cover, and get ready to the turn the computer on. Then put your ear right next to the drive and power the system on. If you hear any kind of grinding, scratching, or rattling fro
m the drive, turn the computer off as quickly as possible and go to the next step. Otherwise go on to step 5.
\par 
\par 4. If the disk has made noise that indicates some sort of mechanical stress, then the problem is the domain of data recovery experts. This is whe
re the client has to make a decision. Do they want to send the drive to a data recovery service, or do they want to destroy the disk in an attempt to recover some data? If the client has information that absolutely needs to be recovered, then send it to t
he professionals. Remember, you cannot service a hard drive unless you are working in a clean room.
\par 
\par If they are willing to destroy the disk and try to get some data off the drive, there is a quick hack available. Place the drive in a static-free bag, then place the drive and static-free bag into a ziplock bag to seal out moisture. Place this into a }{
\b\f1 freezer}{\f1  turned to as low as possible for 24 hours. After 24 hours, pull the drive out and immediately put it into a computer (the faster the better) that boots t
o a floppy and has another hard drive to transfer data to. If the drive wasn't damaged too much previously, you should be able to pull some data off before the metal of the drive heats up and starts destroying the data storage platters. You can repeat the
 process only if you shut down almost immediately and go through the 24 hour freeze process again. Chances are that the first time attempt will be the only chance to recover data.
\par 
\par 5. If the drive boots to an operating system and you can get to either a net
work or backup medium, then start copying the most important data off first. Once that data is off, you can back up less important data. The best bet is to listen to your client to find out what absolutely must be recovered.

\par The reason I suggest BeOS be the boot OS on the hard drive is that it has the ability to mount more file systems than I even knew existed before using it. If you need to access an exotic fi
le system, BeOS 4.5 is almost sure to have a driver available for it. However, the FAT (or FAT16) is the most commonly readable file system around, so generally you will want to transfer data to this file system.
\par 
\par If it becomes apparent that the file syste
m is intact and not infected with a virus (or has had a boot sector virus removed), then you may need to replace the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the drive. Simple. Boot to a DOS disk that has the fdisk utility and run an 'fdisk /MBR' to replace the MBR. R
emember, balance the time it takes to restore the operating system against the time it takes to recover data, get a new drive, and install a fresh operating system.
\par 
\par Normally, disk recovery is simply a matter of recovering the data. Returning a drive to its
 previous state is a goal but may simply be more costly than recovering the data and replacing the drive. How much effort to expend on the process is entirely up to you and the client.

\par Hi there,
\par 
\par A few things can be performed on a crashed drive before declaring it DEAD:
\par 
\par 1. Touch the drive (or listen to it) to feel whether it's spinning. Some drives gradually suffer from spin-up problem but otherwise work fine once spinning. If it doesn't spin at power up, gently }{\b\f1 knock on the
 side the drive once or twice to jump start it}{\f1 
. This works best if you knock on the drive approx. one or two seconds after power is applied. Repeat the procedure a few times and add a little more force if necessary. Remember that too much force can permane
ntly damage the drive, but again, you have nothing too lose at this point.
\par 
\par 2. If drive spins normally and stays spinning, try listening for irregular sounds emitting from the drive. A series of 'clicking' sound usually signifies multiple bad sectors inclu
ding the boot sector that can prevent drive from booting. If drive 'Auto Detect' is enabled, make sure that its signature is shown at boot screen. If not, drive is certainly suffered from major hardware failure.
\par 
\par 3. Check system's CPU to make sure it's not overheating (CPU can run warm, but should not be hot) due to a failed cooling fan, etc. Overheating the CPU can cause the system to be unbootable or cause the system to reboot itself frequently.
\par 
\par 4. You could use another system to test the problematic drive to make sure that the controller is not at fault. Try both "Auto" and "User Type" (where you manually enter the drive's parameters) settings.
\par 
\par 5. Try booting with a floppy and run 'fdisk' to vie
w drive information. Some drives suddenly lost all of their data possibly due to corrupted FAT, but otherwise, continue to work fine once initialized and formatted. In many cases, FAT can be restored by executing Norton Utilities from floppy.
\par 
\par If all faile
d and data from drive must be retrieved, you can try swapping its hardware (drive's main board) with similar working drive. Though this procedure can void drive warranty, but your data is more important, right? Or else, you try services that can save your
 data from dead drive for a fee.
\par

\par Put CMOS back to auto for HD and see if it sees an HD at all. Put in a bootable floppy\emdash can you see the HD? (Don't forget to write protect the floppy in case this was a virus.) Now try EZ-Drive. Some versio
ns (I have several on hand with different advanced options) show what parameters the hard drive is set to in CMOS and what parameters the drive was formatted with. The second set is important. Sometimes the BIOS doesn't auto correctly.
\par 
\par Listen to the HD. I
f it powers up normally by sound (no strong thumping sound) and the platters seem to spin up, you still have a chance. If the drive spins up and then down or if it emits a strong thumping sound, the hard drive is toast and only a professional recovery com
pany with a clean room can help.
\par 
\par If the HD doesn't spin up at all, }{\b\f1 occasionally you can gently slam it down to get stuck platters unstuck and it will spin up long enough to back up your data}{\f1 . The HD is toast physically at this point, and it needs to be rep
laced before trying the slam technique. There were also a few older HDs that had the flywheel exposed, and you could nudge it slightly and they would spin up long enough to back up the data. Again }{\b\f1 these are last resort techniques}{\f1 
 and you ARE planning on replacing the HD anyway.
\par 
\par From here, one of several software products are available to assist you as long as the drive spins up physically to assist the technician. Most of these products can read drives with damaged FAT tables or missing sectors.
\par 
\par And it could be just a simple matter of losing the Active attribute for the partition! Also, viruses can cause this by blasting the partition table, and some of the professional revival products can assist from here.

\par 1) Test the motherboard BIOS/CMOS battery. Often, the hard drive is just fine. But, the internal battery is dead. Some computers like a few Packard Bells I have dealt with have LBA and 32-bit mode turned off by default. Tho
se settings may have been enabled during assembly, but now that the battery is dead they are set back to factory settings (when the user turns his/her computer off) rendering the hard drive inaccessible. Solution: Change the internal battery and enable CM
OS LBA/32-bit mode.
\par 
\par 2) Ask if the computer has been moved recently. Often, when computers are moved, data cables are detached from hard drives and/or motherboards. Obviously, without a data or power cable, a hard drive will never work. Solution: Reattach c
ables and be prepare to actually replace them.
\par 
\par 3) Worst case scenario. It is the hard drive that does not seem to respond. Then, replace the hard drive with a new Master drive and install the faulty drive as a Slave drive. Make sure you install the same Operating System used by the Slave on the Master
.
 Then, proceed to probe the Slave drive. Ideally, at this point you should use diagnostics tools such as Micro-Scope from Micro2000. If you have experience, you should not close the computer box making sure that the Slave drive is within reach. Twice, I h
ave been able to restart a hard drive after }{\b\f1 gently banging on it}{\f1 
 (once as Slave and once as a Master.) Don't miss the boat. Even if you happen to restart the faulty Slave drive, you must copy your info to the Master so that you are not placed in the same si
tuation again because the next time you may not be as lucky. The above procedure works whether the drive is an IDE or SCSI drive. However, when using SCSI hard drive, you may have to test the SCSI card as well. I am leaving now to fix a drive that belongs
 to a RAID pack because it seems to be out of the scope of this drive quiz.

\par When a drive is really gone\emdash cannot be read at all\emdash due to a physical failure, I employ a trick that has yet to fail me.
\par 
\par 1. Install the replacement as an additional drive.
\par 2. Remove the bad drive and smite it firmly on both edges (}{\b\f1 bang it on something solid}{\f1 )!
\par 3. Reinstall it, reboot, and it will work long enough to get the data copied to the replacement drive.
\par 4. I haven't had the opportunity to check this step yet but I think it should work. If it's the boot drive that's bad, mirror the boot partition to the replacement drive, then break the mirror, remove the bad drive rejumper, and boot to the new one.

\par I had to laugh when I saw this easy fix, and it does work. We were able to bring back a failed drive in an older HP server running NetWare 4.11. First step is to remove the drive from the machine. Second, hold the drive flat in your
 palms. Third, shake the drive a few times in an up-and-down motion, like you're trying to hammer a nail. Don't let the drive hit the floor though. I've used this technique on numerous occasions, works every time.

\par For the last resort (when the drive really did die, it-is-not-even-spinning type crashes), there is a possible solution that comes from the early days of hard drives. Back then you were not supposed to turn them off\emdash 
I don't know why but IBM said never turn them off unless you are standing there.
\par 
\par One of our main computers was housed in a closet where I could not hear it well and had a power supply failure that apparently took days to complete. I happened to open the closet for some other reason and discove
red a warm box and immediately went through the shut down sequence to take it off line for a new power source.
\par 
\par Several days later, the unit was shut down again for a long weekend of downtime on a routine maintenance schedule and upon restarting the system
 the hard drive would not work. I am pretty good at backing up everything but could not find the backup disk anywhere. Panic. I am the author of a newsletter that goes to hundreds of subscribers everyday, and the mailing list was on the dead drive. I repl
aced the drive and reloaded everything but was going through sobbing spells as I looked for solutions to recover the lost data. Data recovery companies wanted over five thousand dollars to try to recover the data.
\par 
\par A client of mine told me he once possessed
 an old 286 that required a hair dryer to get it running every time he turned it on. The fellow who had built it for him was an IBM technician and gave him the hair dryer idea because that is what IBM used to do to restart the drives in down machines. So 
o
n the bench machine with the drive out where the dryer could get to it and still be hooked up, I began the process. Lo and behold, it worked. While it was running, I downloaded all the missing data and immediately uploaded it to the new drive. Don't laugh
, I got my outcome and can now say I recovered a fully dead hard drive with my wife's hair dryer.

\par }{\f1 As for me, I have had good success with this method (about 50-50).
\par 
\par I take the drive, and suspend it 4" over a plastic carpet tool (one of those things you see in an office to help the chair wheels go). I then let it "fall" while still holding it, twice on each long edge, then once flat on top and bottom. You want firm, b
u
t not too hard raps on the plastic. I find that the carpet underneath seems to cushion the blow just enough. This appears to work on drives with stuck read-write heads most of the time. If the center bearing is locked up, nothing short of a miracle will b
ring it back. In any case, have a second drive ready to receive your files when you attempt to restart.

\par 
\par There's a bunch of steps I would take if the drive weren\rquote t being recognized by either the auto setup or manual entry.

\par 2) Check for bent pins on the connectors.

\par 6) Here's where it starts getting tricky. By now you must be reasonably convinced you have a bad case of galloping disk rot. On some drives (not all), if you have an identical same model driv
e, you can swap over the logic board. This will let you know if it is the embedded controller on the logic board. With luck, your disk will roar into life and you can suck the data off onto somewhere safe.
\par 7) If your disk is making a hideous noise like a p
eg-legged man with a vacuum cleaner on a wooden floor (whirrr, clunk, whirrr, clunk....), then it is likely you have a dropped head. This is where you have start making decisions about how much your data is worth, because to go any further is going to cos
t big time and may require factory technicians to try and repair the disk in a clean-room environment. If your data was that important, then it would have been backed up. (Of course it would have been, they all respond in loud voices)

\par The following is the normal procedure used at my company (before sending the hard drive to a data recovery agency).
\par 
\par 1. Return the BIOS to the original state. If "auto" for hard drive then "auto,\'94 otherwise to "user defined" with LBA enabled for Microsoft's operating systems.
\par 2. If the system still doesn't boot off the hard drive, then boot off a write-protected bootable floppy using the same operating system and version as what is on the C: drive.
\par 3. If there is no hardware error during the boot process, see if the c: drive ca
n be accessed at all. If it can be accessed and files and directories can be viewed, now is a good time to back up files if the physical condition of the hard drive is suspect.
\par 4. Check the hard drive with an antivirus program. Sometimes computer viruses damage the boot sector. A good antivirus program will identify the problem and may even correct the situation.
\par 5. If there is no virus found on the c: drive, then run "sys c:" to restore the boot files to the hard drive. Only run the sys command if you are 
sure the BIOS settings are the same for the hard drive as before the problem was reported. One way to check this is to look at the file and directory structure of the drive. If you see garbage, then the settings are probably not the same (or the FAT was c
orrupted). Reboot the system after running sys.
\par 6. If the drive boots, you're almost done. If not, then reboot off the diskette and scan the drive for errors. Reinstall the operating system without formatting the drive.
\par 7. If the drive makes any unusual sou
nds or doesn't spin, then your best option is to send the drive to a data recovery agency. Attempting to recover data from a physically damaged disk usually results in further damage to the drive and little chance of recovering any data later. The best qu
estion to ask here is "What is your time and data worth?"
\par 8. In step 6, I said that if the drive boots you're almost done. What's left? Make that recovery diskette, make a backup of the drive and thoroughly scan the hard drive for any physical errors. Perfo
rm the scan last, since the drive may fail during a scan if there are any physical problems with the drive mechanism.

\par In every case, back up the data the minute you see anything that even looks like a directory. Have a drive ready to put i
t on. I like to have a disk drive connected to my test machine and put everything there ASAP. You might be advised to use the "new" drive that will go into the user's machine. Don't put the "bad" drive back unless you just like to make service calls over 
again. These steps have made me a hero more than once on my 17 years as a PC tech and/or salesman. Hope they work for you.

Try booting up on the drive. If it will not boot properly, try FDISK or some other partition viewer to see if it has valid partitions defined. If no valid partitions are defined, or if partitions are unformatted, then the data may 
be lost. Try redefining to the exact same partitions that were known to exist before the problems were encountered. If you have a working drive at this point, but no data, then it is likely that data is gone. If irreplaceable data was lost, you can try br
inging the drive to a hardware shop for professional data retrieval.

\par The most successful methods I have used are:
\par 
\par 1. Find a computer with the exact same operating system (Win 95, Win 98
, etc.) that you can use as a surrogate host. This works best if the secondary IDE channel is unused, allowing the private use of that channel by the ailing drive, and usually eliminating the need of changing jumpers.
\par 2. Go to the drive's manufacturer's Web site (or use a drive parameters database) to get the actual physical drive parameters.
\par 3. Set the surrogate computer's BIOS parameters to expect the ailing drive and turn it off. Auto is the best initial setting. Make sure the second IDE channel is enabled and power management is off, at least for the hard drives.
\par 4. Cable the ailing drive to the surrogate computer's secondary IDE channel using a reasonably long IDE cable (see reason for long cable below).
\par 5. If the drive does not spin during power up whe
n it should (note that some SCSI drives have delayed spin ups), take the drive, hold it in the fingertips of both hands (spider on a mirror style), and rotate the drive's casing around the disk platters inside suddenly (the reason for the long IDE cable).
 
The most effective motion is to prepare by rotating slowly to a starting position where your fingers are turned "up toward" your chest as far as is comfortable for you wrists, then suddenly rotate "down out" from your chest as far as is comfortable, and t
h
en immediately snap back to the original position. This technique works by moving the casing with respect to the platters based on the principle of inertia and will often allow a drive with "frozen" bearings to spin up one more time. Do not expect this te
chnique to work twice!
\par 6. If the drive does not spin up, see a drive/data recovery lab that has the ability to disassemble the drive to get at the platters and recover the data from them by using specialized clean room equipment. When performed by a qualifi
ed lab, this process is quite successful, but very expensive\emdash backups are much cheaper! Choose the right lab, you usually only get one shot...
\par 7. If the computer recognizes the drive, proceed on to recovering the data by any means you desire. Note that since the drive is not the boot drive and host operating system, all of the boot and operating system information are accessibl\endash e\emdash 
no "in use" files!
\par 8. If the computer does not recognize the drive, especially if set to Auto, go to the BIOS and set the drive pa
rameters to the manufacturer specified values and reboot. If still no recognition, try adjusting the values for sector translation. There are several options for the primary translation type (Normal, LBA, Large, etc.), but please note that there may be ot
her settings that also effect drive communications. These other settings usually have values of Yes/No. Some of these other settings are "large drive" (note there are many different names for this setting), "enhanced mode,\'94 and "block mode.\'94
 The important thing is to try different combinations of any of the settings that effect hard drive communications for the second IDE channel. Hint, make a list of all of the possible combinations and check off each one as you try it.
\par 9. Most important, try not to let any
thing (e.g., operating system or "fix-it" programs) mess with the disk contents until you have exhausted all other avenues of access. These programs are great, but should be reserved as the first line of defense against software corruption and the last re
sort for hardware corruption. If your problem is a hardware issue, these programs will usually "finish the job" in terms of denying you the possibility of recovering you data. Only use them AFTER the hardware problem has been corrected.

\par I've had this happen before, and one thing that worked for me involved the following:
\par 
\par The Hard Disk Assembly (HDA) is usually separate from the IDE controller board. If the controller board is the bad part, the data is still good, you just cannot get to it.
 The symptoms for this are: Disk not spinning up at all, "drive not found," or "no boot disk available" type messages.
\par 
\par I've swapped the data module (HDA) from the bad drive controller to a good replacement drive. Usually it's just 4-6 screws and a couple small cables. Use static care procedures as always when working with computer parts.
\par 
\par If the data is good, send the new HDA and bad board back to be fixed, put the good drive (with original data) back in, reboot, and away you go.

\par }{\b\f1 From: Robert K. Kuhn
\par }{\f1 
\par Since you did not state what kind of hard drive this is (MFM, RLL, SCSI, ESDI, IDE/EIDE), I'm going to assume IDE/EIDE.
\par 
\par An "Invalid Drive Type" error usually means that the wrong drive type has been selected in CMOS. I am also going to assume that the BIOS/CMOS supports this hard drive size (some older BIOS\rquote s required a third party softwa
re patch; drives that were 500 MB and larger for instance...). If Auto Detect does not work or if the BIOS/CMOS setup does not have an Auto Detect feature, then I would do as follows:
\par 
\par 1. Verify that the drive is spinning up and that all the cables are hooked up properly.
\par 
\par 2. I would then verify that the drive itself is configured/jumpered correctly (master/slave/single drive). Most of your current IDE/EIDE drives have the jumper setting on the drive itself, which makes it nice. Though some of the older one
s do not, which forces you to call their tech support or search their Web site for jumper configuration.
\par 
\par 3. If I had access to another computer, I would either try swapping out the cable to see if I had a bad cable or I would just simply install the "bad"
 drive into the other computer and see if the BIOS/CMOS detects the drive. If it does not, then chances are very good that the drive is kaput. However, if the other computer does see the drive and I am able to boot up with it, then I have to assume that t
h
ere's a problem with the other computer's IDE/EIDE controller. One last attempt would be to find the geometry of the drive (cylinders, heads, sectors) and add them in manually. If it booted fine with the other computer, the geometry can be copied from the
r
e. Otherwise, a call to the vendor or a search on their Web site would be order. If the hard drive controller is found to be bad, depending on the motherboard (going with the assumption that it has an onboard controller with both a primary and secondary c
o
ntroller), I would check the CMOS to make sure that the IDE controller(s) were enabled. Sometimes you can boot from the secondary IDE/EIDE controller, so I would try that too. If it boots, great! Time for a new motherboard or perhaps just purchase a new c
ontroller and disabling the onboard controller. But I would seriously consider getting a new motherboard when budget allows.
\par 
\par 4. If I only had the one computer, then I would have to search for a known good hard drive (and cable) that the BIOS supports. Then if it too does not boot, then I would have to guess it's something with the
\par controller/motherboard. If it does boot, then I would have lean towards a bad drive.
\par 
\par 5. Sometimes with an "Invalid Drive Type", you can actually boot with a floppy (assuming that the drive is not an NTFS, HPFS, LINUX, Novell NetWare or some other format....) and then access the hard drive. If
\par this can be done, this might be one way to back up any data. You can set up the "bad" drive as "slave" and then with a new drive formatted with whatever format is needed, copy over whatever data that can be read on the "bad" drive.
\par 
\par Back in the good old days, when we had a drive that went beyond the 10
24 cylinders (which is 99.99 percent of all the IDE/EDIE drives made since 1992 and on), we had to "trick" the BIOS/CMOS. This was done by taking the cylinders, dividing the number in half, and then doubling the heads:
\par 
\par Example: 1138 cylinders, 8 heads, 63 sectors\endash s\emdash this would translate to 569 cylinders, 16 heads and 63 sectors.
\par 
\par I would try this trick as perhaps my last resort. But this was used/done on 386/486 machines back in the late 1980s to early 1990s.
\par 
\par One last attempt, and I doubt that it will work but it's worth a shot, would be to get Symantec's Ghost or PowerQuest's Drive Image. A trial copy can be downloaded from their site. See if a drive-to-drive image
\par can be made (from the old "bad" drive to the "new" replacement drive). However, Ghost and Dr
ive Image must be able to read the "bad" drive's partition. One could look into a sector-by-sector copying tool. Back in the late 80s, I had one but for the life of me can't remember who wrote it. But I remember it was shareware. Gibson research, perhaps 
(the makers of SpinWrite, an excellent utility for it's time...)
\par 
\par If the data is that important (mission critical), a drive recovery center would have to deal with it. But be prepared to pay for it! We've had to use a local data recovery center (Hard Disks 
Only) and Gibson Research in the past to rebuild a bad drive. Not cheap but would have cost us more had we not been able to recover the data. Gibson Research is perhaps the best out of the two we've dealt with.
\par 
\par Some other things to consider include that a
 bad power supply can also cause a hard drive not to boot (not allowing it to spin up to full RPM), the amperage required to spin the motor is more than what the motherboard draws/needs even if it has a full bus. Also, I've even seen some ISA, PCI, and AG
P cards cause conflicts with onboard IDE/EIDE controllers (usually in the form of IRQ and/or memory address). Though these are usually funky-specialized boards, I have seen it happen.
\par 
\par Again, I am assuming that the drive is an IDE/EIDE. If it's an MFM, RLL,
 ESDI or SCSI, then the tactics would differ slightly as each are set up and controlled differently. But since IDE/EIDE is perhaps the popular and most used drive, I am going to assume that is the drive.
\par 
\par }{\b\f1 From: Jim Davison
\par }{\f1 
\par Since you did not state IDE/SCSI
, I will assume IDE. I will also assume that drive is not using a bios modifier like those used to make older motherboards support larger drives. (I have seen situations where users tried to enter drive specks in setup for SCSI drives).
\par 
\par I would use the fo
llowing steps even considering that you state the user had "Tried" to manually enter the settings in setup and also tried auto. The user may not know what they are doing. I also would not trust the error codes. I would assume the error codes are only lett
ing us know there is a problem but would not trust the codes to give an accurate description of what the problem is.
\par 
\par 1. In setup, Try IDE Auto Detect to see if the bios can even see the drive.
\par If yes, then I would use that setting and everything should be OK.
\par If yes, and the drive still does not boot, I would use fdisk/mbr in case the Master boot record was destroyed.
\par If no, then I would go to step 2.
\par 
\par 2. Open the box and check all power and data cables.
\par (I have seen Molex type power connectors lose a connection intermittently even if they are plugged in tightly) you need to wiggle them around. (I have also seen one case where the data cable came loose when the computer was moved).
\par If cables were the problem, then you should be okay now.
\par If you still have a problem, go to step 3.
\par 
\par 3. Other Drives are bad and interfering with the boot disk
\par In case anything else is sharing the IDE bus with the drive, e.g., a CD-ROM, then disconnect anything that is also connected to the IDE bus and recheck the Master/Slave settings if necessary and try again.
\par 
\par 4. Possibly a faster way to check if the problem is the drive or something else
\par Remove the drive and plug it into another computer and see if the other computer can detect the drive. If yes, then the problem is a cable, motherboard, etc. on the computer, so go to step 5.
\par 
\par 5. CMOS or Flash problem
\par Put the drive or at least a drive back on the computer with the problem. Go to setup and reload the bios from defaults and then redo the settings and save. Then
 try the IDE auto detect. If this does not work and your system has flash upgrades, then reload the flash. Might as well check for upgrades before refreshing. After refreshing, then again reload the defaults and save settings. Reboot into setup and try th
e auto detects again.
\par If the BIOS can now see the drive but the drive still does not boot, then you may need to reload the OS or at least replace the necessary drivers.
\par If the thing still is not working, then it is most likely a defective drive and you will
 need to decide how badly you need the data on the drive. If you need the data, then I would send the drive to a data recovery lab that can extract the data from a dead drive and save the data to a tape, CD, HD, etc. This can be expensive but may be worth
 it.

\par First thing I would do is to check the BIOS to make the sure t
he disk is set to Auto and doesn't have any settings in it. Then I would reboot the computer using the Win95/98 Setup disk and run fdisk to check to make sure that there are partitions visible. If there are no partitions visible, then I would have to assu
m
e that the data on the drive has departed. Next, if I do see a partition, then I will exit fdisk and go right the C drive. I would run a directory on it to see if all of the files are intact. If they have strange names and numbers, then the drive has suff
ered a serious malfunction and the data is not retrievable. If the directory appears to be in good shape, then I would use Drive Image to make a image file of the hard drive and move it to either a zip disk or a CD-ROM, for the next time this happens.

\par Hi, I have three ideas:
\par 1) Install the hard drive on other machine that is running same OS. If the disk partition is FAT or FAT32, you can start the machine by using WIN98 system diskette without install the hard drive on other machine.
\par 2) We found some problems with hard drive that happen after few minutes of work. In this case, you should disconnect the hard drive from power (by turning off the machine) for few minutes, then turn it on a
nd back up immediately until it will be warm again and you'll not be able to read the data.  Do it until you'll have all files copied.
\par 3) If you have same drive (SAME MODEL), you can replace the unreachable disk's main board and trying to read the data.

\par Hmmm....gotta hate those hard drive problems.....
\par 
\par "The sounds of the game"
\par Let\rquote s take a look at the hard drive itself. Is it plugged in properly? Just ask the customer a polite question about it pos
sibly being moved or bumped. Loose cables are the most common problem in a case like this. If it is plugged in properly, just try to boot it again after checking the connections. Sometimes a connector did come out a bit on one side and you put it back pro
perly without noticing.
\par 
\par "Put the right spin on things"
\par Next, is the drive spinning when you turn the computer on? If it isn't, check the power cable to the drive. If that was fine, tap the drive lightly on the side to see if it spins up. Sometimes that wor
ks (if it does, back it up and order a new drive immediately!). I encountered a drive that acted like this a year ago. If you kept tapping it, it kept spinning. So, for three hours, I sat there tapping this drive until I got all the company's accounting d
ata off of it. Sometimes you have to make sacrifices for your customers.
\par 
\par "Something SCSI this way comes"
\par This may seem stupid, but is the drive a SCSI drive? Again, check the cables and the termination. Boot up and check the SCSI bios to see if it is set up properly.
\par 
\par "Back to the Bios"
\par If the drive is spinning and the cables are properly seated, check the "Detect IDE Hard drives" in the bios. For some reason, on some of the older motherboards, it will pick up a drive that "AUTO" won't pick up.
\par 
\par "Swap meet"
\par The old "swap" maneuver. Is there another drive in the company that is exactly the same? Back up that drive and remove it from the other computer. Remove the logic board on that one and transplant in onto the drive that isn't detecting. Boot up. If it det
ects, get the data off of it and return the logic board to the other drive. Double check that the drive you took the logic board still works! (Warning! Not for the faint of heart! May result in two defective drives!)
\par 
\par "Third Party!!!"
\par Get out the big guns. Tiramisu from Ontrack or DrivePro from Microhouse are great tools to get into spinning drives. DrivePro to set up the drive in the bios, and Tiramisu to retrieve the data.
\par 
\par "Never believe everything you hear!"
\par One thing to remember, listen to the problem the customer has, but find your own solution! I fell into that trap once "I tried this and that,\'94 and yet, after a couple of hours of painful work, I tried the customer\rquote 
s solutions, too. Sure enough, the customer may have tried those solutions, but he didn't do them properly.
\par 
\par These are presented in no particular order. You will do things differently depending on the situation (usually check the bios first and see the problem for yourself, then try to boot it up without doing anything to the machine. Based 
on the sounds the drive makes, or doesn't, this will give you a place to start your problem-solving skills). Also, if the drive does detect, but has bad sectors, try Scandisk (thorough option) or Norton Utilities Disk Doctor. A bad sector can make a bad d
ay too. And a rule of thumb for bad sectors, even one grown bad sector means there is a problem, and should be replaced. Manufacturers may argue this, but in the field, you don't want to take anything for chance.
\par 
\par I really hope these help you out.

\par My solution is as follows: Send the faulty drive and a new (fully tested and compatible) drive to the newly-formed TechRepublic support company where, for a very reasonable fee, the industry-leading expert technicians will solve the problem for me a
nd copy all data onto the new disk!
\par 
\par As well as fixing the immediate problem, a new system will be installed whereby if data is not backed up within a specified period, or if the disk exhibits any pre-crash symptoms (whatever they might be!), the disk will
 be halted and all access to the disk will be prohibited without a special password known only to TechRepublic and myself. Thus, for another reasonable fee, I will be able to go to the customer\rquote

\par Of co
urse, if the user was not backing up the system before this would be a good time to buy backup software since you will be in the store for the new HD. You may also use software like GHOST to make a image of the HD when it is running and install this image
 and ghost software to a bootable CD. When the system does crash, which will happen no matter what you do, remember to always plan for the worse. If you make the CD bootable, you can recover from a crash just by booting from the CD.

\par Another suggestion I would have is have an Application disk that contains all the applications and a different one for data. Keep a good daily backup of the data disk and maybe a backup of the application drive when major changes are performed.

\par I have a really quick, no real science approach to this problem. Assuming that the drive will still spin, there is a quick, however with some risk involved, solution.
\par 
\par In past situations, I have successfully accessed a damaged drive by "replacing the drive.\'94
\par 
\par This method involves the EXACT SAME DRIVE as the one in question.
\par 
\par Step 1\tab With all power off, remove the hard drive in question and place it on the side where it can be easily accessed.
\par Step 2\tab Install the "NEW" drive (a drive of the same type, and manufacturer).
\par Step 3\tab Start the system up and get it to recognize the new drive. It is important to only start a command line session. Remember that we are only trying to copy some files here\emdash this is an emergency maneuv
er. Also, the drive must be formatted the same as the drive we are questioning here.
\par Step 4\tab With the system RUNNING (be careful, this is the risky part I told you about, do it in this sequence), VERY QUICKLY detach the power umbilical from the running drive. Then detach the data ribbon cable from the running drive.
\par Step 5\tab VERY CAREFULLY reach for our drive in question and attach the data ribbon cable to it. Next, VERY QUICKLY place all four contacts simultaneously in contact with the drives power connection.
\par Step 6\tab Now enter at the keyboard some command\emdash 
I use the DIR command. You should see the list of files for the questionable drive that you have HOT PLUGGED into this system. You should now be able to access the files needed to get you over the hump!
\par 
\par What has happened?
\par 
\par The system "thinks" it has the bootable drive you started it with and will allow you to use the device with the exception of booting with it, of course! This approach works quite well on drives that have sector one physically trashed.

\par My business is built on 100 percent On-Site Service. I carry most everything in my van that a 'shop' would have. I have a power inverter for AC power and two network-ready systems at my disposal for backing up customer data 
or to use as a loaner. Anything to get the customer back in business.
\par 
\par }{\b\f1 First}{\f1 : I boot from a floppy and run a program called "IDEID" that will identify the drive. I then compare these results with what is in the BIOS. I also will see if the BIOS can automat
ically and correctly identify the drive. If not, I use the user-defined fields.
\par }{\b\f1 Second}{\f1 : A.) I boot from a floppy and do a virus scan on drive C:. If C is there.
\par \tab  B.) If C is not ther\endash e\emdash I carry a few older hard drives with various boot managers on them. I'
ll make my drive master and boot from it letting my boot manager load. This would allow me to see their drive if I used the right boot manager.
\par \tab  C.) If no boot manager is being used, and C is not present, I use Norton's "NDD/REBUILD" to recover the dos partitions. NOTE: ALWAYS MAKE THE UNDO DISK!
\par \tab  D.) If C is now seen, step B may need to be repeated.
\par }{\b\f1 Third}{\f1 : With C back, I'll identify the version of Dos/Win9X on the system\emdash I carry boot files for all versions back to MS-DOS 3.3.
\par }{\b\f1 Fourth}{\f1 : Boot off of C if possible, "SYS C:" if it is not possible, Reboot!
\par }{\b\f1 Fifth}{\f1 : I use Drive Image to Dupe to an image on a 8.4 GB (remember the 8.4-GB limit!) drive that I carry with me. I let the customer put in a password so they feel secure in my not looking at their data. The a
bove is predicated on the fact that the drive will spin up. If it doesn't, I sometimes have luck in placing the drive upside-down. Sometimes, I'll quickly spin my wrist when I turn the power on. The upside-down mostly worked on the ST1120A/ST3120A drives 
(Seagate 120M). I have no definitive answer as to why. The ST138R had a problem with what I call "STICTION.\'94
 This is my opinion, Seagate! I theorize that the armature would get stuck between the poles of the magnetic fields. In any case, those days are mostly gone.
\par This is usually the extent that I go to. After this, the customer must decide if the data on the drive is worth the cost of the recovery. I end by selling the customer a new drive and restoring their data from the image. This is usually on a secon
d visit since I don't make it a habit of stocking drives for sale in my van.

\par 1. First some background info is needed:
\par 
\par A. Does the BIOS recognize/see the HD? (Correct drive settings? Disk Manager in use?)
\par B. What is the OS? (Win 95/NT/Linux/etc.?)
\par C. What is the partition type? (Fat16/32/NTFS/etc.?)
\par 
\par 2. If A. is yes, and C. is Fat16/32, try a boot diskette (Win95/98). A command prompt, a couple of utilities, and a working parallel port will get your data off safely.
\par 
\par 3. If A. is yes, and C. is NTFS; try a new hard drive as C:, load a new NT/NTFS system, and access the "dead" NTFS drive as the D:. Sometimes the hard drive's onboard controller can fail, yet be chained to another's board a l\'e0
 master/slave mode. Copy the data off ASAP and ditch the old drive to avoid the temptation to keep it as spare storage.
\par 
\par 4. If A is no, try another computer\emdash the BIOS/motherboard/CPU/memory/IO controller may be dead or malfunctioning. Troubleshoot the computer later when you have time.
\par 
\par 5. If all else fails, attempt a drive recovery with Hard Drive Mechanic, or similar drive utility. If successful, copy the data off ASAP.
\par 
\par 6. If the data is EXTREMELY valuable, and if you have a certified clean room/booth (or a professional service), tran
sfer the disk platters into a exact duplicate working drive. This is a very costly option due to the requirements of a certified clean room/booth.

The first step would be to boot off of a DOS startup disk and see if you can access drive C. If you can, then you at least know that you can manually save some crucial files on the machine. If the C drive is not accessible, then you need to 
go into the CMOS settings and see if the proper drive parameters are entered. If it is a newer machine, you can sometimes find a section in CMOS that will query the hard drive and determine the proper settings.

If the drive still won't boot, and you are getting a "non system disk" error

If you are instead getting Invalid drive specification errors, you probably aren't able to access the HD at all, even at a DOS prompt. If this is the case, you probably need to try reviving the drive with a program like Norton Disk Doctor. You hav

\par 1.) Examine all connections inside and outside the PC to ensure they are secure. Remove and label the suspect drive. Make sure all fans are operating correctly. Obtain a replac
ement hard drive and install the operating system and Web browsing capabilities. Retain the box in which your replacement drive was shipped in case you need to ship your suspect drive away to a media recovery firm. Visit the Web site of the hard drive ven
d
or and download the latest version of the vendor's diagnostic program as well as information regarding drive's geometry and jumper options. Determine the keyboard strokes to get into setup mode as well as setting up disk drives for auto detect, etc. Have 
a
n ample supply of blank formatted diskettes readily available. Make sure you have space available to copy any needed files from the suspect drive. Make a boot diskette. FDISK, FORMAT, EDIT, SCANDISK, CD-ROM drivers, and the hard drive vendors diagnostic p
rograms should all be on the diskette.
\par 
\par 2.) Install the suspect drive as a slave. Carefully handle the suspect drive as to not bump it around at all. It may be in a _very_ fragile state at this time. Close the PC\rquote s case or otherwise ensure that there is pos
itive air flow across the suspect drive.
\par 
\par 3.) Take a break, think about how you will do the following carefully and as fast as possible to avoid possibly damaging the drive further.
\par 
\par 4.) Turn on the monitor, inse
rt your diskette from step one. Turn on the PC and go into setup. Determine whether or not the setup program auto-detects the suspect drive. If auto-detect is OK, the disk drive's controller is OK and proceed to the next step. If auto-detect is not OK, th
e
 hard drives controller card(s) are faulty. Try substituting a different controller card from another drive of the same type, if available. Assuming the controller is faulty and swapping the external controller card does not fix the trouble, you have a ch
oice of sending the drive off to have the controller card repaired in a clean room or to abandon your data.
\par 
\par 5.) If the auto-detection was OK, let the PC boot with your diskette. Use FDISK and see if it detects the suspect drive as a partition. If FDISK doe
s not see the drive, you have an internal problem, quite possibly a damaged read/write head or an internal IC. You now have a choice of sending the drive off to be repaired in a clean room or abandoning your data.
\par 
\par 6.) If FDISK detected the partition, you 
may have a damaged file structure. Boot the PC with your diskette and then do something simple like a DIR. You are not ready to even think about writing anything to the suspect drive at this time! If you can not do a DIR, you may be able to recover the dr
ive with Norton or your own favorite program. Keep and label recovery diskettes (don't reuse them), you might need to backtrack.
\par 
\par 7.) If you can do a DIR, try booting up your machine normally. It may be possible to copy directories and files across to your 
new drive. Give priority to the user's data such as mail files, data files, settings, and similar. You probably want to try copying the registry files as well.
\par 
\par 8.) After you have copied the user\rquote s data, try SCANDISK with the thorough option. Always save the files and always make recovery diskettes. The saved files may just need to be examined and renamed.
\par 
\par 9.) If there are any bad spots on the suspect disk, try repairing them with the vendor's diagnostic tools.
\par 
\par 10.) After you are satisfied you have recove
red all of the data from the suspect drive, do a low level format with the vendor's diagnostic program. Do an FDISK and an operating system format and then reuse the drive as you wish. A second hard drive in a system makes a reasonable place to do quick b
ackups as well as for swap files, temporary files, temporary internet files, and the like.

\par I would suspect a bad disk controller first. Before I replaced it, though, if I was lucky enough to get the drive to come up, I would immediately run scan

\par The way I would approach this is to use one of several disk-cloning programs such
 as Drive Copy or Norton Ghost. Both of these programs create boot disks that you can use to "rescue" a failing or error prone hard drive. You boot with this disk and then select either copying a partition to another partition (on another drive) or simply
 clone the entire hard drive. This process is very fast (depending on the machine) and very reliable. It copies all files and even preserved FAT setup and partitions when cloning a hard drive.
\par 
\par Another excellent tool to have in your arsenal is the Norton Bo
ot Disks that will have the Dos versions of Norton scan disk and disk doctor as well as the Unerase and Unformat. These tools can restore lost files and correct and identify many more problems than just Microsoft scandisk even when using the 'scandisk /al
l' command.
\par 
\par Also, try replacing the IDE cable(s) to eliminate the possibility that there is a bad cable. If the error still happens, then the hard drive has probably failed. There is a remote chance that using MaxBlast or a similar hard drive utility from 
its manufacturer will at least identify and hopefully repair the problem. Otherwise...remember hindsight is always 20/20. Especially after you lose data...

\par 1. Use a portable backup tape drive that runs from the parallel port (Trakker).
\par 
\par 2. Use DOS Client and a boot floppy to get the box on the LAN then map a drive with NET USE and XCOPY the important files to the LAN.
\par 
\par Of course, the boot floppy method works for about 75 percent of the failures. If the boot flopp
y fails, I try using FDISK/mbr to rebuild the Master Boot Record. This is successful 5-10 percent of the time. Since the user mentioned in the quiz had messed around with the BIOS, it's possible the settings are wrong and even more probable that the jumpe
r
 on the drive is misconfigured because, although the user "didn't do anything," that new CD-ROM they installed is on the same controller as the hard drive. The disappointing part of making a hard drive spin back to life exists in the 10-15 percent that ar
e actual physical failures that will require depot level repair to extract any data. A very expensive process.

\par Oh, you've got to love these kinds of situations, don't you?
\par 
\par Well, this may sound strange, but it's worked for me before. (That is, if booting off a floppy still won't gain you access...and there are strange sounds coming from the drive...)
\par 
\par 1. Shut down the power and remove the case cover to gain access to the drive. Remove the drive from the case, but leave it connected to power and ribbon cable. (If the ribbon connector cable isn't long enough, attach one that is.)
\par 
\par 2. Now, hold the drive in your hands and kick on the power (use an assistant if you'd like). As soo
n as the power comes on, twist the hard drive quick and fast in your hands. (Kind of like steering a car hard right). This sudden "torqueing" is sometimes enough to "break" a drive free, allowing it to spin...usually for one last time. (Have a Zip or seco
nd drive already ready to gain access to the files.)
\par 
\par 3. A slight variation on this (once again with long power and ribbon cables) is to set the drive down on a flat surface (non-conductive please!) so that it can be "spun" while flat.
\par 
\par Why does this work? Well, in this situation, my guess is that the lubrication of the drive has failed, and the torque overcomes the initial spin-up of the drive.

\par The symptoms you describe would lead me to believe that the drive lost power or died. Maybe the Molex power connector worked loose.
\par 
\par I would use the following steps even considering that you state the user had "tried" to manually enter the settings in setup and also tried auto. The user may not know what they are doing.
\par 
\par 1. Try IDE Auto Detect to see if the bios can even see the drive.
\par If yes, then I would use that setting and everything should be OK.
\par If yes and the drive still does not boot, I would use fdisk/mbr in case the Master boot record was destroyed.
\par If no then I would go to step 2.
\par 
\par 2. Open the box and check all power and data cables. I have seen Molex type power connectors lose a connection intermittently I have also seen one case where the data cable came loose when the computer was moved.
\par If cables were the problem, then you should be okay now. If you still have a problem go to step 3.
\par 
\par 3. Remove the drive and plug it into another computer and see if the other computer can detect the drive.
\par If yes then the problem is a cable, motherboard, etc. on the computer and needs to be replaced. If the thing still is not working, then it is most likely a defective drive and you will need to decide how b
adly you need the data on the drive. If you need the data then I would send the drive to a data recovery lab that can extract the data from a dead drive and save the data to a tape, CD, HD etc. This can be expensive but may be worth it.

\par Boot the PC from a DOS Boot Disk. Make sure that the boot disk has the following files on it:
\par 
\par FDISK.EXE
\par SYS.COM
\par 
\par 1. Boot the computer and see if you can see the drive. If you can, then COMMAND.COM may be damaged or missing or the boot files may be corrupt. Run SYS C: to make the hard drive again bootable.
\par 
\par 2. If you still can't see the hard drive then, run the following command, FDISK /MBR. The FDISK utility updates the master boot record only if one does not exist. Even repartitioning a hard drive with FDISK 
does not necessarily rewrite this information. However, this switch allows you to write the master boot record to the hard drive without damaging the existing partition table information. You should not use this command if you are using special partition 
software (not partitioned with FDISK), if you have a dual-boot disk (such as NT and Windows 95/98) or if you have more than 4 partitions on your drive.

\par {\listtext\pard\plain\s89 \f1\fs20 \hich\af1\dbch\af0\loch\f1 6.\tab}Depending on the manufacturer and model, the drive might require a special boot-time driver to access th
e full capacity of the drive. Two examples are Ontrack Disk Manager, or Maxtor's EZ-Drive. This driver usually resides in the root directory of the system drive or the MBR, and if it is lost, the system won't be able to correctly see the drive partitions.
 
On some later 486s and early Pentiums, even though they can read the drive information into the BIOS, they still cannot properly translate the CHS information. This can lead you to believe that the computer can use the full capacity of the drive, while in
 fact, it cannot. Try re-installing a translation driver using original software, if the drive came with it. This should not require any formatting of the drive or loss of information.

\par I have tried only a couple of steps on my own:
\par 
\par 1. If you are a "computer person" you would have brought a bootable floppy with you. Boot off the floppy and hopefully you can read the c: drive then.
\par 2. Opening up the box and slapping the hard drive can revive the hard drive if the servomotor is "frozen."
\par 3. I have turned the data cable around and powered on, and after about two seconds, turned the box off and then put the cable on correctly. Powered on the box and the system found the hard drive.
\par 4. I have used the utility Speed Stor in the passed to tell the CMOS about the hard drive if the CMOS could not be read from the system. Of course you have to know the head and sector size.
\par 
\par }{\b\f1 From: Lou Schweichler
\par }{\f1 
\par This procedure assumes you do not hear any "grinding noises" or other evidence of a physical damage, i.e. worn-out bearings, dragging read heads, etc. If you do
, then the HDD is "toast" and you might as well offer your customer your condolences as the HDD has just headed to the big computer in the sky and it's cheaper these days to replace the HDD then to repair it.
\par 
\par First, Check the CMOS settings and verify they
 agree with those preprinted on the HDrive's Label, If not preprinted on the label, either use a program like EZ-Drive to obtain the correct values or remove the hard drive and connect it to a known newer motherboard and use that board\rquote 
s CMOS setup utility to detect the proper values. Try rebooting to the C:\\
 prompt on the new board. If successful, reinstall the hard drive to the original board. Then ensure the CMOS settings on the original board agree. Adjust as necessary. Try rebooting. If the your lucky your finished. If not try the second step.
\par 
\par Second, if the first step didn't solve the problem, then the FAT Table may be corrupted. Use a utility like EZ-Drive, which usually can be downloaded from any of the Major HDrive OEM's Web site, to switch to a ba
ckup version of the FAT (file allocation table). Usually there is a backup of the FAT on the HDD, but switching to it requires the use of a HDD utility like EZ-Drive. Follow the instructions for the Advance Options to switch FATs, then reboot. If reboot t
o the C:\\
 prompt is successful, AND you can access your data files, Run SCANDISK from the DOS prompt to verify the integrity of the FAT. Then do a cursory search of the HDD for any documents you may have recently created. If you can get a good DIR listing o
f them, you're done\emdash smoke' em if you got em!. If not, then try third step.
\par 
\par Third, this step will result in the total and absolute loss of all data on the hard drive and should only be used as a last resort. You can use the DOS commands, "FDISK, FORMAT C: 
/S", to reformat the HDD and reinstall the operating system. Better yet, using a HDD utility like EZ-Drive accomplishes this in about one tenth the time. Make sure you have a bootable floppy disk that includes any special device drivers and programs to ac
c
ess your peripheral equipment (like the CD-ROM) so you can complete the OS installation. If your computer system came with a restoration disk, you could reinstall the COMPLETE OPERATING SYSTEM AND ALL SOFTWARE. Alternatively, once the HDD has been reforma
tted and the HDD set up, you should now be able to reinstall the complete operating system, (WIN31, WIN95, WIN98, MAC, LINUX etc.) and all your application software from the original distribution CDs or Disks.

\par Invalid drive specification.
\par 
\par If drive is IDE:
\par 
\par 1) Use the CMOS IDE auto detection. Try to use both LBA mode and normal mode. Reboot and see what (if any) failure comes up.
\par 2) Boot from a floppy (this is critical that the user knows what version of OS he/she is running: 95, 95b, 98, 98b, etc.). Use FDISK after this to see if the drive is present. If so, SYS the drive and reboot (crossing eyes, fingers, and toes).
\par 3) Tear into the computer and make sure the cabling is correct. For good measure, reseat the HDD cable (both ends) and power cable. Turn system on briefly to ensure the HDD is spinning up.
\par 4) Try using the secondary controller on the motherboard (being sure to make the CMOS change as well).
\par 5) Try a different IDE cable.
\par 6) If none of the above steps work, it must be 4th down and time to "punt." If the data is irreplaceable and critical, call Onsite for a quote on data recovery.
\par 
\par If drive is SCSI:
\par 
\par 1) Use the controller utilities to see if the card settings are correct.
\par 
\par Unfortunately I am not experienced in SCSI drives and would not be able to apply anything more than what is listed.

\par Depending on the operating system, I would use a boot disk with FDISK on it. Boot the PC, and run FDISK /MBR, which would fix the boot sector so you would then be able to look at the hard drive after a re
boot. A 2nd option is to use the hard drive manufacturer\rquote s disk utilities from a floppy that MAY BE able to repair without losing data.

\par Solutions:
\par (1) Boot computer from a bootable disk, load CD-ROM drivers. Then run ndd's (Norton Disk Doctor) revive option, this will revive the mbr (master boot record) and all the data.
\par (2) Make the faulty drive slave drive on a system running Win95/98. Try to backup data as much as possible, then shutdown the system and then make the faulty drive as primary drive and boot from a floppy drive and run fdisk.
\par (3) If it doesn\rquote t work, then boot the system with faulty drive as primary drive with a dos/windows bootable disk, then run hard disk manager (e.g. Seagate's DM).

\par The first thing I do is see if the drive is spinning. Many times the drive just gets stuck and a small tap will get the drive spinning again. If that is the case and the drive does come back after some mechanical agitation, I "Ghost" the drive to a new re
placement as fast as I can.
\par 
\par If the drive is spinning but still not accessible, I have had luck making it a slave drive with a known working master. Sometimes that helps. Once I get access, I copy as fast as I can because I know every minute is borrowed time.
\par 
\par When the FAT has become corrupt, I have tried third party recovery tools with little success. If the FAT backup is no good, I am at a loss (short of sending it out to a data recovery service).

\par Check the parameters in the CMOS and verify they are correct. If they are, I would attempt to boot off of a floppy to see if I could get to the hard drive, sometimes the MBR is bad but you can still boot to a floppy an copy the info to disk

\par Iff (If and only if) the drive does
n't spin up, the bearings are possibly dry. In this case, I take the drive out and give it a hard rotation and quick stop parallel with the platters, reinstall, and get out the chicken bones. This will sometimes allow the drive to spin up long enough to g
et the data off. At the same time try to sell the owner on the idea of a backup device.

\par 1. Review documentation regarding the installation\emdash drive type, cylinder, sectors, etc.\endash and identify the drive by physical inspection. Reseat all cables and power connectors. Dust out the interior of the PC.
\par 
\par 2. Secure current info and drivers from manufacturers www site.
\par 
\par 3. Use floppy disk to start the PC and determine if drive maintenance can be performed. Is the data available? Is the drive not booting or not operating? Scan for viruses.
\par 
\par 4. While virus scanning and perhaps using scan disk, review the documentation, instructions, and Readme files about the drive.
\par 
\par 5. Especially with an older PC, check the battery and replace if necessary.
\par 
\par 6. Use setup to confirm accurate drive settings.
\par 
\par 7. Apply any patches, switches, jumpers etc. noted in the current documentation.

\par Had t
his happen last year. Tried running the drive as a slave in another machine (could be the controller, you know) but that didn't do the trick. So we sent it away to a recovery shop. They charge $100 to look at it, send you a list of all the files they coul
d
 find and recover, and then they want $1,500 to send you those files on a CD-R. We balked at the charge and said, "No thanks, just send us back our hard drive." They did. Of course, in order to read the disk and list the files for us, they had to make a r
epair to the drive. When it was returned to us I was able to slave it in another machine and copy all of its contents\emdash just finished before their jury-rigged repair failed on us. Full data recovery for $100\emdash not a bad deal, huh?

\par The process of restoring a drive is fairly straightforward. It relies on just a few facts:
\par 1. The drive data is in BIOS correctly.
\par 2. The data cable is in good condition.
\par 3. The IDE port on the main board is functioning.
\par 4. The drive powers on, i.e. you can hear it spin up.
\par 
\par Having been a field engineer for a number of years, this is one of the worst situations we face. The customer is frantic about the possibility of losing some or all of his data. He never thought that this would (or could)
 happen to him. He has made no effort to back up his data but now wants you to perform some magic that will save the day (and his data).
\par 
\par Onsite retrieval of data is at best a risk that poses undesirable conseque
nces for both the customer and the technician. Your first action is to be as honest with the customer as you can be. Tell him in no uncertain terms that you may not be able to save anything. This does two things: first it allows the customer to prepare hi
mself for the worst outcome (no data), and secondly it allows you to proceed with more confidence in that you are not going to be held responsible for the data that was (or still may be) on the hard drive.
\par 
\par The technical stuff is basic. You should be carryi
ng with you a working boot disk. I like to use my Windows 95/98 setup disk, the one that gives me several options on how to proceed after the initial boot process. I first look at the drive (physically) and get as much information off of the case as I can
. Usually it will include how many cylinders, heads and sectors the drive has. I then go to Setup and input this information in the BIOS. Saving that information I boot to my trusty boot disk and hopefully get an
\par A: prompt.
\par 
\par Using Fdisk I look at the drive 
and see if it still has a DOS partition. If it does then I switch to the C: prompt (if it comes up, I then breath a sigh of relief) and look at the directory tree. This only means that I can see the FAT (File Allocation Table), I still may not be able to 
actually get data off of the drive. Remember that while you are working in DOS, your file names are in the 8.3 format and any information transferred in that environment will be rendered difficult if not impossible to use. So let\rquote 
s say that we have been ble
ssed with a good Directory Tree and we can see the desired information buried somewhere on the platters. Knowing I will most certainly replace the drive, I need to attempt to get the data off of it in its most usable form, which will be in a Windows long 
filename format.
\par 
\par At this point, I'm excited enough about becoming the local computer hero that I pull the drive out and hook it up as a secondary drive to a working system. I then boot the second system and see if it will recognize the drive. It does, and 
I happily transfer the data to a directory on a good drive where I can either burn a CD for the customer or restore it to the new drive when it becomes available.
\par 
\par If you have no second drive available to install the failing disk drive into you are now goi
ng to have to make a tough decision. This premise is far too vague for actual fieldwork but we will say that the customer has no idea where his data resides on the drive (the usual case). Being familiar with the 8.3 format you then ask him what the last 3
 
letters of the filename was. He states .doc or .wpd or some other format. You do a file search such as "dir *.wpd/s" which will then search the drive and its subdirectories for the data. You then can move the data off of the drive to a floppy and even tho
ugh you may have to rename all of the files back to whatever they were originally named, you have the praise and honor of being the guru of the moment.
\par 
\par At best you can hope to get some data for the customer, at worst you now have a working knowledge of the
 system and its integrity (i.e. controllers, peripheral cards, etc.) You also have the opportunity to discuss valid backup options with the customer. But that is another story.

\par Recently I had a machine that would lock up at various t
imes. This was a critical PC attached to a piece of measuring equipment. There was a lot of time invested in writing the measurement programs stored on the hard drive. Of course, the programs were not backed up.
\par 
\par I discovered that if it was cold (had been 
off for some time), it would run for about 10 minutes. To make a long story short, it was a heat-related problem with the hard drive. The warmer the machine got, the shorter the period of time the hard drive would work.
\par 
\par I opened the case up, took the hard
 drive out, stretched the cables out and replugged them so the drive was outside the machine. I found two large zip-lock bags and filled them with ice. I laid the drive on one of them and placed the other on top. I waited about 30 minutes for it to get re
a
l cool. I connected a zip drive to the parallel port and booted the machine. I had plenty of time to make a complete backup to the zip disks. I actually let it run for a couple more hours just to see if it would keep working. When I shut it down, it was s
till working fine. I installed a new hard drive, restored the data from the zip disks and made a lot of people happy.

\par The quiz scenario didn't mention the operating system in use, so I'll assume the user has Windows 95/98 installed on the system.
\par 
\par One simple and valuable tool to have up front is some kind of boot disk, either a Windows startup boot disk from the original software package, or a recent DOS boot or setup disk. I keep a set of DOS 6.22 setup diskettes in my toolkit, since the first dis
k has an extremely important tool: fdisk. (We
\par run a completely NT shop at my company.)
\par 
\par My first inclination would be to open the system and peek at the cabling. PC ribbon cables are notorious for wiggling free from drive connectors, or, even worse, not bei
ng installed securely in the first place. Even the mild vibrations from a power supply fan or even moving a CPU case just a few feet could possibly work the cable off the connector enough to give errors. Eliminate that right off the bat.
\par 
\par The next thing to
 do would be to reboot the system, get into the CMOS or BIOS settings, and reset the BIOS for an automatic setup of the drive (this also assumes IDE drives). Many modern BIOS setups have a utility that scans and sets IDE drive settings. This would be help
ful to get the hardware synched up properly. Make sure the system correctly detects the drive. This should be apparent on the information screens that appear when the system reboots.
\par 
\par If the hardware still can't detect the operating system, one of two thing
s might be wrong. Either the Master Boot Record on the hard disk is corrupt or damaged, or the system is attempting to boot to a partition that isn't bootable. This is where fdisk helps (no matter what operating system you use).
\par 
\par At this point, I would reb
oot the system using the DOS boot diskette. The Microsoft DOS 6.X setup diskette allows you to boot to the first setup screen, then press F3 to exit to a prompt. Fdisk is located on that first setup diskette. From the A: prompt, start fdisk and have a loo
k at what the current partition settings are.
\par 
\par The first thing to look for is to see if there are multiple partitions, and if so, which one is active. If the C: partition is not labeled active, use fdisk to set it to active and try rebooting.
\par 
\par If that fails
, the Master Boot Record on the boot partition may be corrupted. Reboot to the DOS diskette, and at the A: prompt, invoke the fdisk command using the /MBR switch. This won't start fdisk, but it will rewrite the Master Boot Record and may allow you to boot
 the system back to the hard disk partition. I've done this a number of times on systems running Windows 95/98, Windows NT, Linux, and OS/2.

\par 
\par "It was working last time I used it" and "I never touched it" drift into the conversation.
\par 
\par In the case when a HD has failed, it can be due to a number of factors (so many that I wont indulge you). However, one that I find that
 regularly is the fact that the drive will not spin up (listen for spin up and spin down sounds). This can be a common problem particularly after a cold spell, or after a weekend when the machine has been stuck in your spare room in the cold. I have it on
 good authority that often this is caused by the lubricants on the spindles getting thicker due to a temp drop... and the HD motor not having enough inertia to overcome the (now thicker) lube.

\par 7) Cross your fingers.

\par }{\b\f1 From: Dan Calloway
\par }{\f1 
\par I would take the following approach when trying to revive a hard drive that doesn't boot up and where there is
 no startup disk that had previously been made: There are really three different tasks involved here. (1) To get your data off the hard disk; (2) you must make the disk hardware respond to the system; and (3) you may want to make the disk bootable again a
nd perhaps keep it in service. Here are the steps involved:
\par 
\par (1) Boot from the floppy drive with whatever drivers and system files your system uses, then try to read drive C. The first and most important piece of data on the hard disk is the MBR and the par
tition table. There are a number of programs that will read an MBR. One such program is a DOS program called Fdisk. Norton Utilities is another.
\par 
\par (2) If you can read drive C, backup the contents of the disk and then either reformat the disk and reload the data. If you can't read see drive C, then start Fdisk or some other MBR reader to see if the system acknowledges the existence of the hard drive.

\par 
\par (3) If the drive isn't recognized, then check for loose connections and check the drive's configuration in CM
OS. Is the drive too hot or cold? Is it spinning at all? Remove and reseat the controller. A controller swap might possibly make the drive respond where it wouldn't before.
\par 
\par (4) If drive C is recognized, then examine the partition table located in the MBR with Fdisk or Norton Utilities, to see if the partitions are well-defined (they should be for a drive that worked previously).
\par 
\par (5) If the partitions don't exist on the MBR, 
then the response is to rebuild or restore the data to the disk. You may have to rebuild the MBR from a previously backed up copy of it or, if you haven't backed up the MBR, steal an identical MBR from another PC by backing up the MBR from a working machi
ne onto a floppy diskette and restore the MBR of the troubled PC.
\par 
\par (6) Reformat the first track of the disk with an autoconfigure controller. If you can low-level format the disk, then use HDTEST or some other selective low-level formatter to reformat the f
irst track. If this doesn't work, then there is probably a physical problem with the drive at cylinder 0 head 0. Take another hard drive with identical characteristics and partition layout and boot from it. Then park the good drive, disconnect the power l
eads from it before disconnecting the data cables, connect the bad drive up to the system via power and data cables and unpark it.
\par 
\par (7) Next finish up by examining the DBR or DOS boot record. This is the first sector in the DOS partition. It contains a smal
l program that loads the hidden files and boots the operating system. You can repair the DBR by further examining the data structure inside the DBR called the BIOS Parameter Block or DPB. It describes the disk, how many FATs are on the disk, how large the
 
clusters are, what the total number of sectors on the disk are, and so on. You can reconstruct the DPB from a program called DISKLOOK or Norton Disk Doctor. You can write the good data from a working disk to the non-working disk using these utilities to r
evive the drive.
\par 
\par (8) Once the data has been extracted from the drive, throw the bad hard drive away.

\par }{\f1 
\par Upon reading the error, this appears not to be an issue with the drive but the controller or the logic in the auto drive setup. If so, this should work.
\par 
\par Place the drive in a different machine and check all jumpers. Boot from a floppy disk and pray that a drive overlay (disk manager, Ontrack, EZdrive) was not used to setup the drive.
\par 
\par }{\b\f1 From: C.K. Smith
\par }{\f1 
\par This is not an easy one to answer. Al
l of it can depend on the problem at hand (what type of hard drive) and the error messages received. Sometimes, certain brands of hard drives (such as Compaq and CTX) have no "raising the dead". If there is no internal clock, and the hard drive doesn't re
alize it is there ... well ... except for replacing the CMOS chip, say "ADIOS"!

\par 
\par 8. Select 'NTFS BootSector' from the View menu.
\par 
\par 9. From within the NTFS information window, select the 'Go' button next to 'Clusters to MFT' field. The Sector "X" for 1 that is displayed in the Title Bar is the cluster number that begins the MFT, WRITE THAT "X" NUMBER DOWN.

\par I have used the following techniques very successfully for a number of years:
\par 
\par 1. Put the hard drive in the fridge for about 1 hour. Sounds crazy, but this works if the drive suffering from a heat-related problem.
\par 
\par 2. Get hold of an identical working drive, make, and model. Swap the PCB from the working drive to the faulty one. If the PCB was the problem, the faulty drive will now be accessible again.
\par 
\par 3. If the PCB was not the problem, then the HDA is. Chance
s are if it is not accessible, then the boot sector/partition info has been trashed. You can use Norton Disk Doctor to directly edit and repair these areas. Having done this, you can use Disk Clone or Norton Ghost (with ignore errors switch) to then selec
tively copy the readable sectors off to another disk.
\par 
\par 4. If all the above fails, the drive has probably suffered a head crash and the heads or the disk platters are physically damaged. In this case, you need to engage a specialist data recovery service. Th
ey will remanufacture the drive by replacing the damaged parts and recovering the readable sectors off the damaged platters.

\par 1. I will enter into the machine BIOS and see whether it will identify the HD. If not, I will open the machine and look to see if the data cord is connected and the power supply is connected and give them a little push again (sometimes it misplaces)

\par 2. Then I will try 
again to reboot it and check again within the BIOS (if it will not work or the user tried to install a new hard drive when it happened, I will look at the SCSI termination if this is a SCSI HD. If it is a EIDE, I will look at the jumpers settings of the E

DE drives because some HD will not work with the jumper sets as primary with other drives on the same channel [primary or secondary] so the jumper should go out). Then again I will reboot the machine and if it will not work or be recognized inside the BIO

\par Hello, here's my suggestion:
\par 
\par 1. Diagnose if the fault is in the drive or in the machine by plugging the drive to another computer (preferably identical). If you don't have one, go to a computer store and ask them to try it out.
\par 2. If the fault is in the drive, try changing the controller to identical one (from an identical disk)\endash \emdash that is sometimes possible, sometimes no\endash t\emdash 
be careful in this step. With controller, I mean the controller in the bottom of the drive, not the computer's.
\par 3. If that didn't help, plug the drive to a computer which recognizes the parameters of the drive correctly and try a disk reviving t
ool like Norton Disk doctor (if your partitions are format that it understands) or some other that understands your partition format.
\par 4. If the partitions do not exist anymore, at least not visibly to the computer and nothing else helps, it's best to send your drive to a company that restores your data\emdash if it's important enough. Because this kind of restoring costs a lot.

\par First, check to see if a nonboot floppy was left in drive A: The CMOS may be set to read the floppy drive first and will give an error trying to read a nonboot floppy.
\par 
\par Check controller cable connections and power cable connections. Check to see if the power cable is loose or the flat ribbon controller cable is loose at the drive or the controller/motherboard connection.
\par 
\par Check to make sure the cable red line side is plugged to pin 1 at the Hard Drive and the controller/motherboard.
\par 
\par Check the jumpers on all drives for master/slave settings.
\par 
\par Turn on the computer. Hit the Del or other key combination to get into the CMOS setup utility. Make note of the Standard settings for the drives. Verify them with the settings required for the drive. You may autodetect the drive if there are no settings f
or it. Older computers require you set these settings manually.
\par 
\par Reboot the machine and check the settings. If the BIOS has lost these settings you need to replace the motherboard battery.
\par 
\par If it autodetects the drive, try a reboot. If you can read the drive backup everything you can. You can backup files from a DOS prompt. You don't have to get Windows running to backup essential data.
\par 
\par If the reboot doesn't work: Set the CMOS to boot from an appropriate operating system diskette A: or CD and reboot.
\par 
\par If you can read the drive backup everything you can. Use fdisk /mbr to rebuild the boot record. Try to reboot. If reboot still doesn't work, reinstall the operating system.

\par A common problem with incorrect CMOS settings is that the C: drive wil
l not boot. Providing the CMOS settings are valid (that is that they do not specify a bigger drive then what the drive is), then the system should be able to see the drive if you are booting from a diskette.
\par 
\par If you can see the drive from a diskette, then 
you are very close to recovery. Adding another hard drive and xcopying the data will save the data. You can then set the old drive specs to AUTO in the CMOS and then run FDISK/Format and restore the drive. It is a good idea to reboot off the C: drive when
 you have formatted the drive to verify that the drive is okay\emdash it should be if the original problem was a loss of CMOS settings.
\par 
\par If the C: drive was a NTFS partition then of course the booting off the diskette will not see the drive. In this case using a shareware program NTSF4DOS or something like that will allow you to read the drive and copy it to another drive.

\par These are some of the things that I would do...
\par 
\par a) Check the cmos settings to be sure that they are correct for the drive.
\par b) Ask if the user wrote to the disk while the cmos settings were wrong. If they were, then try and use those settings to retrieve some of the data. Sometimes data can be written to the disk and retrieved even if the cmos settings are incorrect.
\par c) Boot off of a floppy disk with a recent virus scanner. It could be a simple virus.
\par d) If it's just a case of the disk not being bootable, do and FDISK /MBR to the drive, or do a SYS C: off of a different Win98/95 boot disk. If it's NT, do a repair of boot/syst
em files. It asks for a repair disk, but you can use any old repair disc for that.
\par e) Stick the drive in another Win9X box (if it was a fat16/32 drive) and run norton disk doctor (tm) on it. Sometimes Norton will recover enough of the directory listings for you to retrieve some of the data
\par f) If none of these work, put 3 hard drives in a machine: 1) NT Workstation (or 95), 2) Bad Drive, 3) exact model and size drive as the bad drive. Format drive 3, and do a sector-by-sector copy of 2 onto 3 with something like Diskprobe.
\par g) Put the drive in a working Windows NT machine and drive RecoverNT.

\par THE SITUATION:
\par You get a call from a user at work, a consulting client, or a neighbor who's found out you're "a computer person." (Sometimes they all call on the same day, don't they?)
\par 
\par Maybe you're lucky. When you get there, the machine boots just fine. The user says, "That computer doesn't like me." You te
ll the user to back up important files while the system is running because you're going to order a new hard drive so this doesn't happen again.
\par 
\par But then there are the times you aren't lucky. You get messages like "disk 0 error" and "invalid drive specification." I recently got those errors trying to revive the hard drive of a Compaq Prolinea 4/66.
\par 
\par It doesn't matter what the box is, though.
\par 
\par The circumstances are all too familiar:
\par The data isn't backed up.
\par The problem came out of nowhere.
\par The user had accessed Setup and tried to manually enter the settings for the drive type when "Auto" didn't work.
\par There was no startup disk made by this machine.
\par Reviving a drive like this one\emdash even if only long enough to copy its data before you put it in File 13\emdash is a tough challenge. How would you approach it?
\par 
\par THE SOLUTION:
\par 
\par Before going on-site I would be sure to have my various boot disks available (DOS6.22, Win9x, WinNT and AntiVirus) containing the usual disk and file utilities, a spare hard drive and a small hammer.
\par 
\par When I arrive on-site, I would first reset the CMOS settings to factory default. There can sometimes be corruption of the CMOS and can cause drives to seem to have "failed". Then I would go over the CMOS settings and make the appropriate changes for that 
particular system, including setting the primary HD to AUTO. If this fails, then I would boot to floppy and determine if FDISK can see the drive. If not, then it\rquote 
s time to open the case. With the PC turned off, I would first check the drive cables to verify
 a solid connection to both power and data cables,and install my spare drive (to save data with). With the case still open, I would power-on the machine and listen carefully for the drive to spin up. If I cannot hear the drive spinning up, then I would re
m
ove the drive (with power off of course). Then with the drive in my hand and still connected, I would power up the PC again, feeling for the centrifugal force the drive would create from the spinning platters. If there is no torsion effect felt, then this
 would mean that the platters are not spinning and that the heads may be '\'94stuck.\'94
\par 
\par This is where the hammer comes in. Power up the PC again and LIGHTLY tap the drive case edge once or twice with the hammer handle. This will usually unstick the heads from t
he platter and allow me to copy the data (or whole drive depending on the situation) to the spare drive for safekeeping until the user can purchase a new drive.
\par 
\par If this also fails, then once again the hammer comes into play...this time to allow the user to beat the crap out of the old drive and relieve the frustration of having lost everything because they thought "backups are for sissies."

\par Other times, you may want to use the old handy command, SYS a: c: (Re-creating the system files on the C drive).
\par 
\par U
sually, if these don't work, your drive can be sent to a data recovery center (if the data is just so critical that they can't live without it.) Usually, this costs hundreds of dollars.... And you would still have to replace the hard drive in order to obt
ain the data back from the recovery center.

\par You need to first figure what is not (or is) happening. If the drives are just not spinning, you might be in luck. Otherwise, you had better be carrying the 'toolkit' (mostly software these days).
\par 
\par Drives not spinning? Open the box, and check the cards and cables. Does the floppy \'94seek.\'94 If it should and should not, check the power +12v is required mostly for motors...
\par 
\par Nothing loose, then pull and reseat everything\emdash esp. the memory. Watch it, make sure you are grounded... you left the system plugged in right? No plug, no ground.
\par 
\par Still nothing? Here\rquote s one Seagate tech support told me in the early 80's\'85 it still works like a charm. Pull the hard disk from the chassis and plug the power and data back in. Then holding the drive in the le
ft, with the CABLE end towards you, BUMP IT with the HEEL of your right hand. ONCE medium hard (this will unseat magnetics, release brake mechanisms, and even pull heads stuck in soft platter coatings.... I've looked).
\par 
\par Still no go, try one more bump WHEN you first turn the power on.\'85 Sometimes stuck heads need the motor to move before they will spin.
\par 
\par LAST ATTEMPT to spin, pull the cover (This will not destroy data recovery service offerings. Just make sure nobody smokes around you and it\rquote s fairly clean.) off the drive. CAREFULLY with power on, push the platter to spin it.
\par 
\par Finally, do you have another drive same model? You can swap logic boards...just don\rquote t leave it that way. The read/write electronics are balanced to the heads inside the drive. This MAY work if you have a bad motor chip, etc.
\par 
\par Now you can send the drive to the service for data recovery and the big bill.
\par 
\par IF IT\rquote S NOT A SPIN PROBLEM, use a drive id software (many available) to check how the drive SAYS it\rquote s set... even though the bios does no
t get this report does not mean the drive is dead to this question...! No answer, you can use some software (like Disk Mangler\endash \emdash 
commercial) to rewrite track 0. THIS IS dangerous, so know what you are doing. I practiced on bad drives that I had first.
\par 
\par Other things not quite right, swap the PLACEMENT of RAM in the system... surprised? Shouldn\rquote t be. Ram is used for just about anything, right from the start. Check the POWER. Use a good meter.

\par With all troubleshooting, you have to have a logical approach and be able to eliminate problems. When I get a call from end users that a hard drive has failed I first ask several questions that will help determine the course of my actions.
\par 1. I first ask what were they doing before the failure, i
.e. did the PC perform and illegal operation in an application and have to be rebooted? Did the user just turn the PC on and nothing would happen? Is the hard drive making any kind of unusual sounds?
\par 2. I've found most sup
posed hard drive failures are really operating system problems, and can easily be repaired without taking the case apart. I usually like to turn the PC and pay close attention to any error messages that come up. Since I always have a Win95 boot disk with 
me, I usually boot to DOS so I can at least attempt to recover any data by copying data files onto floppy disks.
\par 3. Then I usually reinstall Win95. In worst cases, I have to fdisk the hard drive a reinstall the OS and all applications.
\par 4. On the other hand, I've had disk drive fail because of bad cables (a good indication of this is if the BIOS can't detect the hard drive), power supply problems, and bad power cables.
\par 
\par It's important to work logically and try to eliminate the easy stuff before you have to replace a hard drive.

\par Unfortunate the box does matter!
\par 1) Open the box and check for HD's model; go to manufacturer\rquote s Web page; find out the details (Heads, Cylinders, sectors per track) and use those at setu
p, configuring manually the HD's params; download specific software (EZdrive, etc.) for the HD's model.
\par 2) Check for OS the user is running.
\par 3) If OS is MS-based (excluding NT), then get a boot disk under Win95b/98; start the machine and use the program yo
u've downloaded or if the HD is old, try to use NDD (only if OS is MSDOS or Win95 do not try to use it if there is a possibility to have VFAT32 installed).
\par 4) Usually most of us do carry with them some startup diskettes with an antivirus, so USE IT FOR BOOT (I myself use an emergency Boot Disk made with the help of McAfee AntiVirus since it's very usual to run up to a virus).
\par 5) If all the above are pretty hard to do, then try to install the new HD, and OS; connect the old HD as a secondary master (or primary slave if that's easier) and start the computer booting from new HD and try to access the old one.
\par 6) If the old one is inaccessible then be sure that the drive was installed through BIOS without using any overlay driver to expand BIOS's addressable HD c
apacity; If there was, try to get from Web the latest update of that driver and install it temporarily (Use a boot diskette rather then installing at Primary Master's Boot Sector) and boot from that diskette.
\par 7) Hopefully you've been able to access HD. If 
not there may be some tools in the manufacturer's soft you've downloaded; otherwise ... try to stay calm!!! and proceed with some Web searching. There are some good tools to access the partition and try to fix it manually (If you Dare) using a disk editor
 to repair boot partition. Well it 's much more complicated sometimes but you may try it at your own risk. Or you may just say " Hmmmm..... Told you so... Sorry there is no way out... you should keep backups!" (an easy solution :->)

\par I have just had this exact problem. I had a drive with an NTFS partition and a FAT partition. The NTFS parti
tion was my boot partition. Anyway, the sorry story was that my girlfriend hit the power cord accidentally while doing the vacuuming and the resetting of the computer caused the boot sector and the MFT to corrupt.
\par After much searching, I found a helpful article (http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q153/9/73.asp) on the MS site describing how to repair the boot sector.
\par I built a new NT machine and went through this process. I could then mount the partition but it still showed up as unknown in Disk Administrator.
\par I looked for ages on the net and the only thing I found (over and over) was a program called RecoverNT. I downloaded this and went through the instructions. It said to format the drive (that is fo
r my symptoms) and it then searched the entire drive cluster by cluster to find the files.
\par The only real annoying this is that the demo copy only allows for 3 files to be restored and it costs US$250+ to buy). Even though it's expensive, I must say it does
 a great job, both for NTFS and FAT. Unfortunately for me, I still was not able to recover my PST file and Tracker DB\endash both of which must be corrupt badly as they were open at the time).

\par The procedure I suggest is absolutely a last resort thing to do.
\par I've would have tried to replace the hard drives controller-card. The card sitting on top of the disk. Usually it can be removed. And m
ost likely malfunctioning controller card is the reason for the hard drive crash. But it have to be replaced with another card from the same type of hard disk. In a corporate environment this would be easy, but alas, it may be more difficult in a home sit
