- I have a Mac mini [[hooked]] up to my TV that I use as a media centre to watch movies, TV [[shows]], home movies, play music, and view photos.

- __(As far as I’m aware downloading TV shows **is** technically illegal. But I could record them on my TV using Sky+ (UK), TiVo etc. To me this is just another way of watching TV shows I have already access to, and it’s a much nicer experience to store them like this to watch them when I want.)__

- I subscribe to TV shows on a torrent site. An app called [Automatic](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fcodingcurious.com%2Fautomatic%2F&t=ZmU5OWQ1OWQzZGM2ZDRjNGJhNjM0MTVkNjRhZmFjMmU3ZjhlOTZjZixYOWNqTTlwUw%3D%3D&b=t%3AC4O6exn_HyyZn6czpNn9Sg&p=https%3A%2F%2Fjonohunt.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F43465545825%2Fusing-hazel-automator-to-process-tv-shows&m=1&ts=1602351893) downloads the torrent files via RSS feeds, and then [Transmission](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.transmissionbt.com%2F&t=ZDhkNWM3YjhmM2U0NTBmYWNhYmE4NjJmYTBkMjE2MTFhNjVhNjMyMyxYOWNqTTlwUw%3D%3D&b=t%3AC4O6exn_HyyZn6czpNn9Sg&p=https%3A%2F%2Fjonohunt.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F43465545825%2Fusing-hazel-automator-to-process-tv-shows&m=1&ts=1602351893) downloads the episodes.

- Hazel watches a Downloads folder on the Mac mini and copies the TV shows to the appropriate folders where Plex scans and grabs the information.

#### [ForkLift 3 - User Manual - most advanced file manager and FTP client for macOS](https://binarynights.com/manual)

- Using ForkLift will come very easily. If you are used to Finder, everything will look familiar, and all the extra functionality will work as you expect it. ForkLift's user interface has got highly modular by now. You can have it anyways, from a minimal single pane look to the pedal-to-the-metal 3 ton engineering monster it can become, depending on what you need at the moment.

- #### Main

- #### Path Bar

- The path bar is displayed at the top of each main pane and shows the path of your current location. You can click the items in the bar to quickly navigate up in your filesystem. The path bar also supports drag and drop.

- ##### Show Devices

- Click on the icon in the path bar or use the Control-D shortcut to list connected devices and servers.

- #### View Modes

- There are three ways to view items in Forklift: as icons, as a list, or in columns. To choose a view, use the View buttons in the toolbar or the View menu. In dual pane mode, you can split panes vertically or horizontally.
