- I want to #journal in a new daily note (click on "Open today's note")
- I want to #process new #source material, adding my own #commentary.
	- From that processing, I want to make new notes.
- I want to further #develop (TK) half-formed blocks of atomic thoughts into fuller notes
- I want to forge, collide, and craft ideas in an #MOC note
- I want to navigate my existing spatial constellation of ideas. 
	- Either go to: [[(050) 🔥 Interests|Interests]] or "Open graph view"
	- I just want to browse around and have fun. Same as above
- I want to review my timestamped notes
