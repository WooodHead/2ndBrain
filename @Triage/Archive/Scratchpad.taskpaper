TaskPaper Mode:
Editorial supports the .taskpaper plain text todo list format, invented by Jesse Grosjean of Hog Bay Software (see http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper).

The TaskPaper "markup" is very simple: To create a task, just start a line with a dash and a following space.
- This is a task Please go to Shortmoji's settings and set "Insert Text" text.
	Editorial automatically shows a checkbox instead of the dash, but the file is still saved as plain text, and you can open it in any other editor. 

Tasks can be tagged, using the '@' symbol.
- Another task @home 
The special @done tag is used to mark finished tasks.
- A finished task @done(2020-06-26)
(Tags can contain additional information, like the completion date in parentheses.)
You can quickly add or remove the @done tag by tapping the checkbox.

To insert a project header, simply type a line that ends with a colon (':'). Everything that isn't a task or project header is considered a note.

Color Labels:
In Editorial's settings, you can associate tags with color labels. Some tags, like @due, @flagged, and @today have default colors, but you can easily change this.
- This task should be blue  @today
- This one is red @flagged

Tips:
- Tap the triangle next to a project header to hide ("fold") its content. The label next to a folded project shows the number of tasks that are hidden. 
- You can rearrange tasks by dragging the right margin (tap and hold the gray box).
